<p>in relationships, if both parties are willing to hang in there, pay attention, and change direction when we make mistakes, we can improve the relationship.</p>

<h1 id="step-one-look-at-my-bids">step one: look at my bids</h1>

<ul>
<li>what makes marriages succeed or fail? self-disclosure: a person&rsquo;s willingness to reveal his or her most guarded, personal thoughts and experiences to another person.</li>

<li><p>&lsquo;after collecting and viewing hundereds of hours of videotape, i found very few examples of self-disclosure. there were a few heart-to-heart exchanges about broken dreams, hidden fears, or unfulfilled sexual desires.</p></li>

<li><p>maybe it&rsquo;s not the depth of intimacy in convo that matters. it doensn&rsquo;t even matter wheter couples agree or disagree. maybe the important thing is how people pay attention to each other.</p></li>

<li><p>the topic of convo hardly matters in couples&rsquo; willingness to connect.</p></li>

<li></li>

<li><p>by choosing to turn toward, turn away, or turn against each other&rsquo;s bids for connection - no matter how ordinary or small - we establish a foundation that could determine the future success or failure of their relationships</p></li>

<li><p>the importance of playfulness in people&rsquo;s bids.</p></li>

<li><p>people who make playful bids and turn toward one another&rsquo;s bids enthusaistically during everyday conversations have more access to humor later on, when they get into an argument</p></li>

<li><p>responding with good humor has become such a habit in their relationships it&rsquo;s always at the top of their bag of tricks</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-bids-work">how bids work</h2>

<ul>
<li>the closer we feel to others, the more intense, frequent, or demanding our bids for emotional connection with them mayne .</li>
<li>we typically ask first for help with matters that require the least time attention risk or intimacy</li>
<li></li>

<li><h3 id="typical-ladder-of-needs-within-a-friendship">typical ladder of needs within a friendship</h3></li>

<li><p>small talk</p></li>

<li><p>humor</p></li>

<li><p>friendly gossip</p></li>

<li><p>affection</p></li>

<li><p>support</p></li>

<li><p>problem solving</p></li>

<li><p>connection</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-do-bids-look-like">what do bids look like</h3>

<ul>
<li>thoughts</li>
<li>feelings</li>
<li>observations</li>
<li>opinions</li>
<li>invitations</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="nonverbal-bids">nonverbal bids</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>affectionate touching</em> back-slap, handshake, pat, squeeze, kiss, hug, back or shoulder rub</li>
<li><em>facial expression</em> smile, blowing a kiss, rolling or eyes, sticking out our tongue</li>
<li><em>playful touching</em></li>
<li><em>affliating gestures</em></li>
<li><em>vocalizing</em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fuzzy-budding">fuzzy budding</h4>

<ul>
<li>the most common is to avoid emotional risk. openly bidding for connection can make us feel vulnerable. in career and mating situations, our hearts and egos are on the line.</li>
<li>subtle dynamics of bidding:</li>
<li>bids can also be hard to decipher when the bidder doesn&rsquo;t ack his or her own needs for connection (this is so me)</li>
<li>temper tantrums, crying fits, belligerence, and sassiness could be bids for conection. children do those things to look for emotional bond with people who can help them feel more</li>
<li>adults can express their need for connection in the same confused way</li>
<li>instead of making ordinary bids for connection we  keep our longing for afffection and attention to ourselves</li>

<li><p>we want to feel close to the person we love but we are very ineffective in the way we do</p>

<h5 id="why">why?</h5></li>

<li><p>making ambiguous bids to avoid vulnerability or emotional risk</p></li>

<li><p>unintentional poor communication, such as inexplicit language</p></li>

<li><p>framing bids in negative ways that are hard for others to hear or accept</p>

<h5 id="responses">responses</h5></li>

<li><p>turn toward the bid: respond positively</p></li>

<li><p>turn away from it: avoid</p></li>

<li><p>turn against it: outright rejection</p></li>

<li><p>might involve action</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="high-energy-responses">high energy responses</h4>

<ul>
<li>full attention with good eye contact. usually enthusiastic</li>
<li>involve humor, kidding, or affection</li>
<li>sincere empathy</li>
<li>involve broad physical gestures like big hugs, ceremonious kisses, enthusiastic handshakes, or mock sparring.</li>
<li>it tells the other person</li>
<li>I hear you</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m interested in you</li>
<li>i understand (or would like to)</li>
<li>im on your side</li>
<li>id like to help you (whether i can or not)</li>
<li>id like to be with you ()</li>

<li><p>i accept you (even if i dont accept all your behavior)</p></li>

<li><p>when you turn toward a bid, it helps the bidder to feel good about themselves. the bidder welcomes more interaction, leading to mor ebids and more positive responses from both sides</p></li>

<li><p>leads to growth and development of healthy partnership</p></li>

<li><p>lead to fewer conflicts, because the partners are having conversations they need to have</p></li>

<li><p>siblings who turn toward one another in conversation are more likely to maintain close, supportive, satisfying relationships</p></li>

<li><p>form more productive work teams, with higher morale</p></li>

<li><p>such playfulness is extremely good for relationships and it only requires willingness to turn toward another sense of silliness.</p></li>

<li><p>not all bids for connection are good-natured and playful. we can sometimes camouuflage our bids in expressions of anger, fear and sadness. <em>once i recognize them, i&rsquo;ve got to muster the patience, creativity, and trust</em> it takes to turn toward the bidder with a helpful response</p></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="if-you-want-to-build-solid-long-term-relationships-i-ve-got-to-be-willing-to-turn-toward-each-other-s-bids">if you want to build solid, long-term relationships, i&rsquo;ve got to be willing to turn toward each other&rsquo;s bids</h5>

<ul>
<li>we long for relationships with people who will stick by us even when we&rsquo;re tired, crabby, fearful, depressed, or frustrated</li>
<li>the less people turn toward one another, the less satisfying their relationships are</li>
<li>a long story of turning toward one another</li>
<li>if you want to build a deeper emotional connection with somebody, turn toward that person as often as you can</li>
<li>this depends on how comfortable each of you feels with the level of independence and intimacy in your relationship</li>
<li><em>adult-child relationships</em> children are often less reciprocal than adults. be patient and keep responding positively to the child&rsquo;s bids for attention, because it will pay off in the long run.</li>
<li>make it a point to turn toward people with fun-loving, high-energy responses when you can</li>
<li>this type of enthusiastic, positive response has an impect on people&rsquo;s ability to access humor</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="negative-responses-to-bids">negative responses to bids</h3>

<ul>
<li>we want to gain more autonomy in a relationship</li>
<li>turning away helps us to regulate the balance between freedom and interdependence.</li>
<li>if you find yourself in a relationship where either one of you is regularly turning away, look carefully at your intentions. if either of you is turning away in order to gain more autonomy in the relationship, it&rsquo;s important to talk about our relative needs for independence.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="preoccupied-responses">preoccupied responses</h4>

<h4 id="disregarding">disregarding</h4>

<h4 id="interrupting">interrupting</h4>

<ul>
<li>people rarly intend to be malicious or mean-spirited when they turn away. they&rsquo;re often operating on &lsquo;autopilot&rsquo;</li>

<li><p>remedied by being more conscious of our interactions</p>

<h4 id="the-message-it-sends">the message it sends</h4></li>

<li><p>i dont care about your bid</p></li>

<li><p>i want to avoid your bid</p></li>

<li><p>im not interested in your interests</p></li>

<li><p>ive got more important things on my mind</p></li>

<li><p>im too busy to pay attention to your bid</p></li>

<li><p>your bid is not worth my time</p></li>

<li><p>i want to be more independent than you want me to be</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-do-people-respond-to-that-bid">how do people respond to that bid</h4>

<ul>
<li>most people feel hurt. they may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation, and rejection. theres a little kid inside all of us that feels that way when our bids are ignored or dismissed</li>
<li>a person may feel so distressed that he becomes hypervigilant or oversensitive to insult</li>
<li>when somebody turns away from a bid, the bidder loses confidence and self-esteem</li>
<li>they dont get puffed up with anger; they dont get indignant; they just seem to fold in on themselves. they feel defeated. they give up.</li>
<li>feeling discouraged once their bids for connection have been rejected or ignored, people rearely re-bid. even in satisfied relationships, couples dont even rebid. if this hopeless attitude becomes dominant, theres less bidding, less opportunity for connection</li>
<li>habitually turning away can eventually destroy relationships.</li>
<li>dismissed bidder typically gets fed up. forming a pattern of attack and defend.</li>
<li>adults in the family dont mean to neglect their kids or cause them harm but theyre so consumed by their own problems that every interaction with their kids amounts to telling them to be quiet or go away.</li>

<li><p>start paying more attention to the details of her boys&rsquo; lives: make a concertaed daily effort to offer them praise for the things they were doing right, and to ask them about their activities in a way that showed she was really listening</p></li>

<li><p>the more people turn away from one anotherm the more conflict they&rsquo;ll have to contend with later on. the more they turn toward one another&rsquo;s bids, the less contentios their relationships will be</p></li>

<li><p>you can&rsquo;t make a habit of turning away and expect the relationship to survive</p></li>

<li></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="turn-against-bids-for-connection">turn against bids for connection</h3>

<ul>
<li>theses responses make the bidder feel hurt and rejected</li>
<li>if the respondent holds a psition of power over the bidder, the bidder may even become anxious or afraid, which leades to suprressing feelings and avoiding conflict. its not unusual for people to remain in such suppressed, conflict-avoiding relationships for a long time</li>

<li><p>at some point, bidders stop the biddiding and partners dirft apart. even when they stay in the relationship, they may quit interacting with each other altogether</p>

<h4 id="contemptuous-reponses">contemptuous reponses</h4></li>

<li><p>entail hurtful, disrespecting comments aimed at the person bidding for connection. thoses put-downs are delivered with an air of superioirty, as if the speaker wants to put some distance between the bidder and the biddee, and intentional insults will do the trick</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="belligerent-responses">belligerent responses</h4>

<ul>
<li>provocative or combative. a sense that the speaker is looking for a fight. they would argue with whatever the bidder says. involve unfair teasing or a dare</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="contradictory-responses">contradictory responses</h4>

<ul>
<li>less hostile but still blocks the bidder&rsquo;s attempt to connect</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="domineering-responses">domineering responses</h4>

<ul>
<li>the goal is to get the bidder to withdraw, retreat, or submit</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="critical-responses">critical responses</h4>

<ul>
<li>broad-based attacks on a bidder&rsquo;s character</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="defensive-responses">defensive responses</h4>

<ul>
<li>create a sense of separation by allowing the speaker to relinquish responsibility for matters at hand.</li>
<li>they may have simply developed a personal style of relating thats crabby or irritable</li>

<li><p>often its a spillover of self-criticism that has its origins in the distant past. the problem may also be a biologically based irritability that is chemically related to depression</p>

<h5 id="the-kind-of-message-it-sends">the kind of message it sends</h5>

<ul>
<li>your need for attention makes me angry</li>
<li>i feel hostile toward you</li>
<li>i dont respect you</li>
<li>i dont value you or this relationship</li>
<li>i want to hurt you</li>
<li>i want to drive you away</li>

<h2 id="difference-between-men-and-women">difference between men and women</h2>

<ul>
<li>husbands in happy marriages turned toward their sposes with much greater frequency than husbands in unhappy marriages</li>
<li>but wives turned toward their partners with the same frequency whether their marraiges were happy or not</li>
<li>men may hold a significant key to determining whether or not their marriages will succeed.</li>
<li>in partnerships where spouses turned away from each other&rsquo;s bids, husbands and wives are likely to get hostile with one another during disagreements</li>
<li>in marriages where partners turned against each other, husbands typically suppressed their feelings or became hostile. wives suppressed their feelings</li>
<li>women whose husbands consistently turn against their bids may simply feel too frightened</li>
<li>understress, men tend to become more irritable and critical than women</li>

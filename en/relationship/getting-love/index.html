Soon my friend and Chris and the baby were sitting out on the back deck, sipping ice tea. Since the May sunshine was pleasantly warm, Chris took off the baby’s clothes so he could sunbathe. The two women chatted while the little boy crawled around on the deck, happily digging his fingers into the warm soil of the flowerpots. After about half an hour, the baby became hungry, and Chris put him to her breast. My friend noticed that as the baby nursed he developed a miniature erection. Apparently nursing was such a sensual experience that he felt pleasure throughout his body. Instinctively, the little boy reached down to touch his genitals. Unlike most mothers, Chris did not pull his hand away. Her baby was allowed to feel the warm sun on his naked skin, nurse from his mother’s breasts, have an erection, and add to his pleasure by holding on to his penis.\n  it is normal and naturla for an infant to want to have good feelings, but we rearly allow it. When we were young, there were many, many times when limits were placed on our sensuality.  forbidden feelings  our emotions were another prime candidate for socialization. parents encouraged sociable behaviors like laughter and discouraged it is rare for parents to validate a child’s anger. if i react to my daughter’s anger with something like:  “I can see that you’re mad. You don’t want to do whatI ask. but i am the parent and you are the child and you need to do what i say.”\n  having her anger acknowledged would contribute to her sense of self.  tools of repression  conditioned by our parents to be aware of acceptable behaviors. we come to the conclusion that some thoughts and feelings are so unacceptable that they should be eliminated, so we construct an imaginary parent in our head to police our thoughts and activities, a part of the mind that psychologists call the ‘superego’ whenever a child has a forbidden thought or indulges in an ‘unacceptable’ behavior, he expereinces a self-administered jolt of anxiety. this is so unpleasant that the child puts to sleep some of those forbidden parts of himself. he represses them. the ultimate price of his obedience is a loss of wholeness  the false sense  we create a ‘false self’ a character structue that serves a double purpose: it camouflages those parts of his being that he has repressed and protects him from further injury. when he gets into a love relationship, he will criticize his partner for her desire for intimacy and her intact sexuality.  we adopt negative traits from our parents  why don’t people simply tell each other in plain English that they want more affection or attention or lovemaking or freedom or whatever when we were young, we were taught that the only way to get what we want is to provoke people around us this primitive method of signaling distress is characteristic of most couples immersed in a power struggle even though their partners react to these maneuvers with renewed hostility, they  stages of the power struggle   it followws a predictable course, one that happens to parallel the well-documented stages of grief in a dying or bereaved person.\n  first comes the shock, that horrifying moment of truth w find a way tohen a window opens and a wrenching thought invades your consciousness: this is not the person I thought I had married.\n  at that instant you assume that married life is going to be a continuation of the loneliness and pain of childhood.\n  after shock comes denial.\n  after that you feel betrayed. you are in pain, and the degree of your pain is the degree of the disparity between your earlier fantasy of your partner and your partner’s emerging reality.\n  fourth stage: bargaining. this stage goes like this: if you will give up your drinking, i will be more interested in sex.\n  last stage is despair. no hope. 5% find a way to resolve the power struggle.\n  we enter relationships with the unconscious assumption that our partner will become a surrogate parent and make up for all the deprivation of our childhool. all we have to do to be healed is to form a close, lasting relationship\n  the partner is perceived as witholding love. we begin to hurt each other, or deny each other pleasure and intimacy, in hopes of having their partners respond with warmth and love.\n  becoming conscious  Seldom or never does a marriage develop into an individual relationship smoothly without crisis. There is no birth of consciousness without pain. C.G.Jung\n reromanticizing  through daily repetitions of psitive behaviors, your old brain begins to perceive your partner as ‘someone who nurtures me.’ your old brain associates your partner as a wellspring of life. this opens ways for intimacy, which is only possible in a context of pleasure and safety it helps people erode the infantile belief that their partners can read their minds. when they fail to satisfy their secret desires, they assume that they are deliberately depriving them of pleasure. most relationships are run like a commodities market, with loving behaviors the coin in trade. this comes straight out of the hood: our childhood. when we were infants, love came without price tags. we want to be loved and cared for without having to do anything in return. when our partners grant us caring behaviors independent of our actions, our need for unconditional love appears to be satisfied. often, partners in a relationship cater to their own needs and preferences.  do unto others as they would have you do unto them random reinforcement  a pleasurable action loses its effectiveness if it’s repeated with predictable regularity. gifts are so customary that they are almost taken for granted  ","wordCount":"1362","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-11-24T20:34:24-05:00","dateModified":"2020-11-24T20:34:24-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"baoqdau"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/relationship/getting-love/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"baoqdau","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.banhtrang.me accesskey=h title="baoqdau (Alt + H)"><img src=/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>baoqdau</a>

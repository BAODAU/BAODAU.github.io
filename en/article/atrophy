People said that the goal of writing is to write as little while still packing in a lot of information. It's a powerful yet practically impossible idea. That's why successful people are voracious readers, there is simply no way to learn a lot of things without acknowledging that most of the time authors are not necessarily good at summarizing their topics of choice but having enough knowledge on that matter.

Maybe the good thing is that knowledge compounds. Reading a lot means that there is more information to process.  I spent my life wondering how people had done things that I would otherwise think impossible.

It’s sad and pathetic but it’s also enlightening, I guess.\nIt’s enlightening in a way that most people I’ve met feel this way.

Our daily hit of dopamine probably comes from a popular social media platform.\nMost of us feel that we are not living up to our expectations and that we have to atone for it. While rationally I don’t believe that this is true, we haven’t seen but a modicum of how vast and beautiful this world is. Yet we, or at least I and my friends, condition ourselves to think of our personal developments as an ultimate truth in life. Anyday that we are not working toward that goal is a day wasted. In another word, we are taught to measure our self worth based on our contributions to the world. It wouldn’t be that bad if the byproduct of that thinking is a sense of dread and self-pity if we fail to achieve things we want.\nAt least that’s what I feel. But feel is an overloaded word. I don’t feel like this as if this is a core belief of mine. I feel like this when I’m tired. I feel aimless like this when I’m not managing my time so that I can spend most of my time doing things that I find meaningful.\nTo put it in a way that most of my friends can relate, I feel like I’ve been doing the logistics too long. I have been taking classes, learning soft skills, improving myself. Things like those surely lay a good foundation to everything, they are like the tutorial parts of a video game. But it is only there to make sure I know how to play a game. It is inherently unrewarding because its sole purpose is to guy players towards the meaningful part. And I’ve been grinding this tutorial for too long. Or is it? Who knows.\nWhat I’m saying is, I feel like I’m barely touching the tips of the iceberg. Life is more than just waking up, going to class, going to the library to do homework, and writing a blogpost complaining how you’re tired of doing all of those for too long.\nBut of course, the whole thing that I just said is simply not true. I probably shouldn’t treat my life as either meaningful or meaningless.\nIt’s funny, I know that what ever I think of right now. Somebody smarter and more educated had thought of this before and had written about it. They had probably come to a better conclusion. Well, I should treat this essay as a concretization of my little system of beliefs when I was 20. I should read more.\nIn a time of senselessness, what do I seek? Will it be Nietschze, will it be ancient Buddhist texts, will it be Netflix, a talk with one of my friends, or do I just power through all of this all by myself?\nGoddamn it, I hate meta questions. I just want to do something rewarding. Something that is beneficial in the long term. At the same time, though, I hate doing grudge work. Why? Because I only live once. I am entitled to wanting stuff and getting it.\nI don’t know much about Buddhishm. But I vaguely remember that the moment I’ve asked for the wrong thing, I would spend my life chasing the ephemeral stuff. Well guess what. I’m not trying to live my life the perfect way.

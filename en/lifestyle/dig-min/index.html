I can enjoy solidue in a crowded place. solitude can be disturbed in the form of reading a book, listening to a podcst, watching TV, or performing just about any activity. solitude requires me to move past reacting to information created by other people and focus instead on my own thoguhts and experiences.   All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone. - Blaise Pascal-\n  I have read abundance of fine things on the subject of solitude… I acknowledge solitude an agreeable refreshment to a busy mind. - Ben Franklin-\n  Edward Gibbon lived a solitary life. but he was very productive and happy. A great deal of time alone is the common factor among creative people. the ability to be alone is a rejection of close bonds. it helps build appreciation for interpersonal connections when they do occur.   We enter solitude, in which also we lose loneliness -Wendell Berry\n Solitude deprivation  oh my god. we allow headphones to provide background noise for our entire day. it undermines our time alone with our own thoughts. Spotify provides me the ability to be CONSTANTLY distracted from my own mind. it is pushing us toward a newly alienated phase in our relationship with our own minds. the smartphone provided a new technique to banish these remaining slivers of solitude: a quick glane we’ve been sold the idea that more connectivity is better than less. without solitude, I lose the ability to clarify hard problems, regulate my emotions, build moral courage, strengthen relationships. if i suffer from chronic solitude deprivation, the quality of my life degrades. smartphones make you anxious. humans are not wired to be constantly wired  practice 1 leave my phone at home practice 2 take long walks  walk in scenic places without headphones. time doing this is an investment.  practice 3 write letters to yourself dont click like??  man is by nature a social animal.social cognition: when given downtime, our brain defaults to thinking about our social life. people are naturlaly interested in their own social life. social media makes me feel both connected and lonely, happy and sad. the more you use social media to interact with your network, the less time you devote to offline communication. there exists a tradeoff. using social media tends to take pepole away from the real world socializing thats massively more valuable. the small boosts i receive from posting on a friend’s wall or liking their latest Ig photo can’t come close to compensating for the large loss experience by no longer spending real world time with that same friend. IRL interactions require our brains to process large amounts of info about subtle analog cues such as body language, facial expressions, and voice tone. digital tools underutilize our social processing networks. humans are naturally biased toward activities that require less energy in the short term. even if it’s more harmful in the longterm. so we end up texting our sibling instead of calling them on the phone. or liking a picture of a friend’s new baby instead of stopping by to visit. its difficult to reist checking a device in the middle of a conversation. our dumb brain cant distinguish betwee nthe importance of the person in the room with us and the new person who just us a new text. novel tools are engineerd to hijack our primitive brain, having a very addictive allure. if i spend multiple hours a day compulsively clicking and swiping. theres much less free time left for slower interactions. we are also delusional in thinking that we’re actually building or maintaining our relationships. making further action unnecessary. conversation is what counts. those whose relationship with you only exists on social media: let them go.  reclaiming conversation  face-to-face conversation is the most human and humanizing thing we do. fully present to one another, we learn to listen. its where we develop the capacity for empathy. its where we experience the joy of being heard, of being understood. young employees retreat to email because the thought of an unstructured conversation terrifies them, and uncessary office tensions that fester when communication shifts from nuanced conversation to ambiguous connection f2f convo unfolds slowly. it teaches patience. we attend to tone and nance. when we communicate on our digital devices, we learn different habits.  not anti-technology. it’s pro-convo  anything textual or non-interactive – all social media, email, text, instant message, doesnt count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection.a logistical role. as in. it should be used to set up and arrange conversation. or to efficiently transfer practical onfo. connection MUST BE a supporter to conversation.   real conversation takes time  conversation is the good stuff. it is what we crave as humans and what provides us with the sense of community and belonging necessary to thrive you cannot expect an app dreamed up in a dorm room, or among pingpong tables of a silicon valley incubator to replace the types of rich interactions to which we’ve painstakingly adapted over millennia. our sociality is simply too complex to be outsourced to a social network or reduced to instant messages and emojis.  practice 4 consolicate texting  phones have become woven into a fraught sense of obligation in friendship. the more we text the less necessary you’ll deem real conversation and when i get the chance to actually talk i’ll compulsively check my phone keep do not disturb mode on my default  practice 5 hold conversation office hours  tell my friends and acquaintances that i’ll be able to talk to them at a certain time. no need to schedule literally just call me at that time.  reclaim leasure  the best and most pleasant life is the life of the intellect - mf Aristotle it’s easy to fill the gaps between work and caring for my self and sleep by pulling a smartphone or tablet, and numbing myself with mindless swiping and tapping.  bennet principle financial independece: my assets produce enough income to cover my living expenses. when i achieve FI, i have more leisure hours to fill than the average person. so theres a community behind this movement and they provide valuable insights into high value leisure.\npassive leisure activities associated with young men  palying video games, watching sports, web surfing, long evenings at the bar.   when we are provided large amounts of leisure time, we often voluntarily fill these hours with strenuous activity. Inactivity leads to depressive boredom.   I wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life. – teddy roosevelt\n  hours should be put to use on demanding and virtuous leisure activities. Expending more energy in my leidure will end up energizing me more. That’s the old entrepreneurial adage “You have to spend money to make money” several hours of idle watching and screen tapping will make us more fatiged than when we began  craft  many of us experience thw world largely through a screen. we live in a world that is working to eliminate touch as one of our sense. when we use craft to leave the virtual world of the screen. a deep activity that requires a lot of effort like writing a piece of computer code  fix or build something every week  handy: comfortable picking up a new physical skill when needed. for most people its no longer essential for either their professional or home lives to function smoothly.  practice 6 schedule my low quality leisure  schedule in advance the time i spend on low quality leisure.  practice 7 join something  structured social interactions: important. acting on this knowledge requires hard work. join organizations that bring interesting people together for useful ends. if we can’t find such gatherings, we should create them from scratch. listlessness and boredom are not acceptable join clubs first and work out the other issues later  practice 8 follow leisure plans  high achievers are meticulous strategists. they lay out a vision for what they;re trying to accomplish on multiple different time scalesm connecting high-level ambition to decisions about daily actions. without a well considered approach to high quality leisure, our commitments will degrade because of the firction of daily life.  season leisure plan weekly leisure plan  get into the habit of creating detailed plans for my week. Oh my god im so behind in everything im scared. dont worry about rigid timetable.  join the attention resistance practice 7 delete social media from my phone practice 8 turn my devices into single purpose computers practice 9 use social media like a professional embrace slow media  the right response to digital bombardment is mindful media low information diet decide how and when we consume media  pracice 10 dumbdown my smartphone -  ","wordCount":"2192","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-11-22T16:31:20-05:00","dateModified":"2020-11-22T16:31:20-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"baoqdau"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/lifestyle/dig-min/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"baoqdau","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.banhtrang.me accesskey=h title="baoqdau (Alt + H)"><img src=/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>baoqdau</a>

What if we could understand why we are so compelled to desire what other people have, or to identify so strongly with a group\nThe survival of our earliest ancestors depended on their ability to communicate with one another well before the invention of language.\nBeing around people stirs up our anxieties and insecurities as to how others perceive us. Once we feel such emotions, it becomes very hard to observe people as we are drawing into our own feelings, evaluating what people say and do in personal terms: do they like me or dislike me?\nYou will think in terms of opposites - when people display some trait, such as confidence or hypermasculinity, they are most often concealing the contrary reality. People are continually playing to the public, making a show of being progressive and saintly only to disguise their shadow. If people take an action that seems out of character: what often appears out of character is actually more of their true character. If people are essentially lazy or foolish, they leave clues to this in the smallest of details that you can pick up well before their behavior harms you. The ability to gauge people’s true worth, their degree of loyalty and conscientiousness, is one of the most important skills you can possess.\nMaster your Emotional Self You like to imagine yourself in control of your fate, consciously planning the course of your life as best you can. But you are unaware of how deeply you emotions dominate you. They make you veer toward ideas that soothe your ego. They make you look for evidence that confirms what you already want to believe. They make you see what you want to see, and this disconnect from reality is the source of the bad decisions and negative patterns that haunt your life. Rationality is the ability to counteract these emotional effects. It does not come naturally; it is a power we must cultivate, but in doing so we realize our greatest potential.\nRationality is not a power you are born with but one you acquire through training and practice. You are infected by all of the drama that others churn up; you are reacting to what people give you, experiencing waves of excitement, insecurity, and anxiety that make it hard to . Your attention is pulled this way and that, and without the rational standard to guide your decisions, you never quite reach the goals that you set. At any moment this can change with a simple decision. Rationality is then what you will value the most and that which will serve as your guide.\nYour first task is to look at emotions that are infecting your ideas and decisions. You will begin to think for yourself instead of reacting to what others give you. Emotions tend to narrow the mind, making us focus on one or two ideas that satisfy our immediate desire for power or attention, ideas that backfire.\nQuestion yourself  Why this anger or resentment? Where does this incessant need for attention come from?  Transform Self-love into Empathy The Law of Narcissism We possess the tool for attaining social power: empathy. When cultivated and properly used, it can allow us to see into the moods and minds of others, giving us the power to anticipate people’s actions and lower their resistance. This instrument is blunted by our habitual self-absorption. We are all narcissists. Our mission in life is to come to terms with this self-love and learn how to turn our sensitivity outward.\nThe Narcissistic Spectrum we humans feel a never-ending need for attention. We are social animals to the core. Our survival and happiness depend on the bonds we form with others. If people do not pay attention to us, we cannot connect to them on any level. As those who have gone through long periods of isolation, without eye contact we begin to doubt our existence and to descend into a deep depression. Through the quality of attention we receive from others, we feel recognized and appreciated for who we are. Our sense of self-worth depends on this. People will do almost anything to get attention, including committing a crime or attempting suicide.\nWe face an inevitable problem: there is only so much of it to go around. We have to compete for attention. People can lbe indifferent to our fate, as they must deal with their own problems. There are some who are downright hostile and disrespectful to us. How do we handle those moments when we feel psychologically alone, or even abandoned? We can double our efforts to get attention and notice, but this can exhaust our energy and it can often have the opposite effect: people who try too hard seem desperate and repulse the attention they want.\nFacing this dilemma, most of us come up with a solution: we create a self, an image of ourselves that comforts us and makes us feel validated from within. This self is composed of our tastes, our opinions, how we look at the world, what we value. In building this self-image, we tend to accentuate our positive qualities and explain away our flaws. If our self-image is too divorced from reality, other people will make us aware of the discrepancy, and we will doubt ourselves. If it is done properly, in the end we have a self that we can love and cherish. Our energy turns inward. We become the center of our attention. When we experience those moments when we are alone and not appreciated, we can retreat to this self and soothe ourselves. This self-image operates as a thermostat, helping us to regulate our doubts and insecurities. We ar eno longer dependent on others for attention and recognition. We have self-esteem.\nIn childhood, if narcissists are extroverts they can thrive. They become masters at attracting attention. But underneath the surface, they are addicted to the hits of attention. If they are introverts, they will retreat to a fantasy life, imagining a self that is quite superior to others. They will not get validation of this self-image from others because it is so unrealistic, they have moments of great doubt and even self-loathing. Lacking a coherent core, they could imagine themselves to be anyone. The nightmares for deep narcissists arrives in their twenties and thirties. They have failed to develop that inner thermostat, a cohesive sense of self to love and depend upon. The extroverts must attract attention to feel alive and appreciated. They become more dramatic, more exhibitionistic and grandiose. This can become tiresome and even pathetic. They have to change friends and scenes so that they can have a fresh audience. Introverts fall deeper into a fantasy self. Being socially awkward yet radiating superiority, they tend to alienate people, increasing their dangerous isolation. In both cases, addiction can become a necessary crutch to soothe them in the inevitable moments of doubt and depression.\nYou can recognize deep narcissists by the following behavior patterns: If they are ever insulted or challenged they have no defense, nothing internal to soothe them or validate their worth. They generally react with great rage, thirsting for vengeance, full of a sense of righteousness. This is the only way they know how to assuage their insecurities. They will position themselves as the wounded victim, confusing others and even drawing sympathy. They are prickly and oversensitive. Almost everything ist taken personally. They can become quite paranoid and have enemies in all directions to point to. You can see an impatient or distant look on their face whenever you talk about something that does not directly involve them in some way. They turn the conversation back to themselves, with some story or anecdote to distract from the insecurity behind it. They can be prone to vicious bouts of envy if they see others getting the attention the feel they deserve. They frequently display extreme self-confidence. This always helps to gain attention, and it neatly covers up their gaping inner emptiness and their fragmented sense of self. But beware if this confidence is ever truly put to the test.\nWhen it comes to other people in their lives, deep narcissists have an unusual relationship that is hard for us to understand. They tend to see others as extensions of themselves, what is known as self-objects. People exist as instruments for attention and validation. Their desire is to control them like they control their own arm or leg. In a relationship, they will slowly make the partner cut off contact with friends: there must be no competition for attention.\nSome highly talented deep narcissists manage to find some redemption through their work, channeling their energies and getting the attention they crave through their accomplishments, although they tend to remain quite erratic and volatile. Lacking the self-esteem thermostat, they are prone to worrying about what others think of them. This makes it hard to focus attention outward for long periods of time, and to deal with the impatience and anxiety that comes with work. There types tend to change jobs and careers quite frequently. This becomes the nail in their coffin: unable to attract genuine recognition through their accomplishments, they are forever thrown back on the need to artificially stimulate attention.\nDeep narcissists can be annoying and frustrating to deal with; they can also become quite harmful if we get too close to them. They entangle us in their never-ending dramas and make us feel guilty if we are not continually paying them attention. Relationships with them are most unsatisfying, and having one as a partner or spouse can be deadly. The best solution in such cases is to get out of their way, once we identify them as a deep narcissist.\nThere is one variety of this type that is more dangerous and toxic because of the levels of power they can attain: the narcissistic leader. Full of narcissistic self-confidence, they attract attention and followers. they say and do things that other people don’t dare say or do, which seems admirable and authentic. They might have a vision for some innovative product, they can find others to help them realize their vision. **They are experts at using people. **\nIf they have success, a terrible momentum is set in place - more people are attracted to their leadership, which only inflates their grandiose tendencies. They are hypersensitive. They also like to stir up constant drama as a means to justify their power: they are the only ones who can solve the problems they create. This also gives them more opportunities to be the center of attention. The workplace is never stable under their direction. Sometimes they can become entrepreneurs because of their charisma and ability to attract followers. They can have creative flair as well. But for many of these leader types, eventually their own inner instability and chaos will come to be mirrored in the company or group they lead. They have to control everything and everyone, their self-objects. They will proclaim this as a virtue - as being authentic and spontaneous, when in reality they lack the ability to focus and create something solid. They tend to burn and destroy whatever they create.\nScale of Narcissism let us imagine Narcissism as a way of gauging the level of our self absorption as if it existed on a measurable scale from high to low. At a certain depth, let us say below the halfway mark on the scale, people enter the realm of deep narcissism. Once they reach this depth, it is very difficult for us to raise ourselves back up because we lack self-esteem device. If they engage with others, some comment or action will trigger their insecurities and they will go plummeting down. But they tend to sink deeper into themselves over time. Other people are instruments. Reality is a reflection of their needs. Constant attention is their only way of survival.\nAbove that halfway mark is what we shall call the functional narcissist, where most of us reside. We also are self-absorbed, but what prevents us from falling deep into ourselves is a coherent sense of self that we can rely upon and love. This creates some inner resiliency. We may have deeper narcissistic moments fluctuating below the mark, particularly when depressed or challenged in life, but inevitably we elevate ourselves. Not feeling continually insecure or wounded, not always needing to fish for attention, functional narcissists can turn their attention outward, into their work and into building relationships with people. It is ironic that the word narcissism has come to mean self-love, when it is in fact the case that worst narcissists have no cohesive self to love, when it is in fact the case that the worst narcissists have no cohesive self-love, which is the source of their problem.\nWhat to do with our own narcissism Understanding We must understand the phenomenon of the deep narcissist. Although they are in the minority, some of them can inflict an unusual amount of harm in the world. We must be able to distinguish the toxic types that stir up drama and try to turn us into objects they can use for their purposes. They can draw us in with their unusual energy, but if we become enmeshed, it can be a nightmare to disengage. They are masters at turning the tables and making others feel guilty. Narcissistic leaders are the most dangerous, and we must resist their pull.\nOur nature We must be honest about our own nature and not deny it. We are all narcissists. In a conversation we are all champing at the bit to talk, to tell our story, to give our opinion. We like people who share our ideas: they reflect back to us our good taste. If we happen to be assertive, we see assertiveness as a positive quality because it is ours. Whereas timid people will rate it as obnoxious and value introspective qualities. We are all prone to flattery because of our self-love Moralizers who try to separate themselves and denounce the narcissists in the world are the biggest narcissists: they love the sound of their voice as they point fingers and preach. We are all on the spectrum of self-absorption. Creating a self that we can love is a healthy development, and there should be no stigma attached to it. Without self-esteem from within, we would fall into deep narcissism. But to move beyond functional narcissism, which should be our goal, we must first be honest with ourselves. Trying to deny our self-absorbed nature, trying to pretend we are somehow more altruistic makes it impossible for us to transform ourselves.\nHealthy narcissist They have a stronger, more resilient sense of self. They tend to hover closer to the top of the scale. They recover more quickly from wounds or insults. They do not need as much validation from others. They realize at some point in life that they have limits and flaws. They can laugh at these flaws and not take slights so personally. By embracing the full pictures of themselves, their self-love is more real and complete. From this stronger inner position, they can turn their attention outward more often and more easily. This attention goes in one of two directions: creative work or people.\nBecause their outward focus on the work is more intense, they tend to be successful in their ventures, which gives them the necessary attention and validation. They can have moments of doubt and insecurity, and artists can be brittle, but work stands as a continual release from too much much self-absorption.\nThe other direction is toward people, developing empathic powers. Imagine empathy as the realm lying at the very top of the scale beyond: complete absorption in others. By our very nature, we humans have tremendous abilities to understand people from the inside out. In our earliest years, we felt completely bonded with our mother, we could sense her every mood and read her every emotion in a preverbal way. Unlike any other animal or primate, we also had the ability to extend this beyond the mother to other caregivers and people in our vicinity.\nThe need to develop this empathy is greater than ever. Young people are more self-absorbed since the late 70s. If your attention is continually interrupted by the need to look at phones, you can never understand the feelings or perspectives of other people. You are drawn back to yourself, never really engage. **Even in a crowd, you remain essentially alone. ** People come to serve a function - not to bond with but to placate your insecurities.\nOur brains were built for continual social interaction; the complexity of this interaction is the main factors that increased our intelligence as a species. At a certain point, involving ourselves with others has a net negative effect on the brain itself and atrophies our social muscle.\nYou must try to fight against these developments and create empathic energy. As you tune up your empathy , you get constant positive feedback. People want to be around you more. You develop your empathic muscle; your work improves; without trying, you gain the attention that all humans thrive on. Empathy creates positive, upward momentum.\nEmpathic skillset Empathic attitude The greatest danger you face is your general assumption that you really understand people and that you can quickly judge and categorize them. The people around you present a mask that suits their purposes. You mistake the mask for reality. Let go of your tendency to make snap judgments. Open your mind to seeing people in a new light. Do not assume that you are similar or that they share your values. Each person you meet is like an undiscovered country, with a very particular psychological chemistry that you will carefully explore. This flexible is similar to creative energy. Developing your empathy will also improve your creative powers.\nThe best place to begin this transformation is in your numerous daily conversations. Desire instead to hear the other person’s point of view. You have tremendous curiosity in this direction. Cut off your incessant interior monologue as best you can. Give full attention to the other. What matters is the quality of your listening, so you can mirror back to the other person things they said or things that were left unsaid but that you sensed. As part of this attitude, you are giving people the same level of indulgence that you give yourself. When we make a mistake, we attribute it to circumstances that pushed us into doing it. When others make a mistake, we tend to see it as a character flaw.\nAdopting this attitude depends on the quality of your self-love. If you feel terribly superior to others, or gripped by insecurities, you moments of empathy and absorption in people will be shallow. What you need is a complete acceptance of your character, including your flaws, which you can see, appreciate, and love. You are not perfect, you are not an angel. You have the same nature as others. From a position of genuine inner strength and resilience, you can more easily direct your attention outward.\nVisceral empathy Empathy is an instrument of emotional attunement. People are continually affecting our moods. What you are doing is turning this physiological response into knowledge. When they talk, they have a feeling tone that is either in sync or not in sync with what they are saying. This tone can be one of confidence, insecurity, defensiveness, arrogance, frustration, elation. You must try to detect this before even paying attention to what they are saying. This will register to you viscerally, in your own physical response to them.\nA key element you are trying to figure out is people’s intentions. There is always an emotion behind any intention. People do shit to gain things. When we see someone smiling and in a good mood, it tends to have a contagious effect on us. Mirroring people on any level will draw out an empathic response from them. This can be physical and is known as the chameleon effect. People who are connected physically and emotionally will mimic each other’s gestures and posture. This is why people who score high on empathy are generally excellent mimics.\nEven better, you can enter the spirit of the other person. You absorb their mood deeply and reflect it back to them. You create a feeling of rapport. People crave this emotional rapport in their daily lives. It has a hypnotic effect and appeals to people’s narcissism as you become their mirror. In practicing this type of empathy, you must maintain a degree of distance.\nAnalytic empathy The reason you are able to understand your friends or partner is that you have a lot of info about their tastes, values, and family background. We’ve had the experience of thinking we know someone but over time having to adjust our original impression once we get more info.\nThere are people who we can’t put ourselves in their shoes. Naturally we resort to judging and putting them into categories. There are people out there who are not worth the effort - supreme fools or true psychopaths. But for most others who seem hard to figure out, we should see it as an excellent challenge and a way to improve our skills.\n I don’t like that man. I must get to know him better.\n  Abraham Lincoln\n Analytic empathy comes mostly through conversation and gathering information that will allow you to get inside the spirit of others. You want to read on people’s values, which are mostly established in their earliest years. People develop concepts of what they consider strong, sensitive, generous, and weak often based on their parents and their relationship to them. By not understanding people’s values, you will misread their reactions and create unnecessary conflicts.\nYour goal is to gather as much as you can about the early years of the people you are studying and their relationship to their parents and siblings. Keep in mind that their current relationship to family will also speak volumes about the past. **Try to get a read on their reactions to authority figures. **This will help you see to what extent they have a rebellious or submissive streak. In general people love to talk about themselves and their past.\nIf people seem reluctant to talk, try asking open-ended questions, or begin with a sincere admission of your own establish trust. In general people love to talk about themselves and their past, and it is usually quite easy to get them to open up. If they come from another culture, it is important to understand this culture from within their experience. Your goal is general is to find out what makes them unique.\nProcess You need feedback. You sense a greater rapport and how certain techniques have worked for you. The more people you interact with in the flesh, the better you will get at this. The greater the variety of people you meet, the more versatile your skill will become. In an encounter, keep your attention active to see how the other person changes over the course of a conversation and the effect you are having on them. Be alive to the moment. Try to see people as they interact with others besides you: people are often very different depending on the person they are involved with.\nTry to not focus on categories but on the feeling tone and mood that people evoke in you, which is continually shifting. You will notice more. Continually mix the visceral with the analytic.\nSeeing improvement in your skill level will excite you greatly and motivate you to go deeper.\n The deepest principle of Human Nature is the craving to be appreciated.\n  William James\n Four examples of Narcissistic Types When you listen to others, do it with such intensity and interest, that your eyes bore into your opponent. People like Stalin seemed to pick up your deepest thoughts and doubts. But his greatest trait was to make you feel important and part of the inner circle of revolutionaries. You have to create a sense that there is now a bond that link you and your opponent together forever.\nHow can someone connect with others when they are so clearly self-obsessed? These types have more ambition and energy than the average deep narcissist. They also tend to have even greater insecurities. The only way they can mollify these insecurities and satisfy their ambition is by gaining from others more than the usual share of attention and validation, which can only come through\n","wordCount":"4201","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/images/lawshuman.png","datePublished":"2020-12-30T03:20:31+07:00","dateModified":"2020-12-30T03:20:31+07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"baoqdau"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/learn/laws-of-human-nature/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"baoqdau","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.banhtrang.me accesskey=h title="baoqdau (Alt + H)"><img src=/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>baoqdau</a>

What if we could understand why we are so compelled to desire what other people have, or to identify so strongly with a group</p><p>The survival of our earliest ancestors depended on their ability to communicate with one another well before the invention of language.</p><p>Being around people stirs up our anxieties and insecurities as to how others perceive us. Once we feel such emotions, it becomes very hard to observe people as we are drawing into our own feelings, evaluating what people say and do in personal terms: do they like me or dislike me?</p><p>You will think in terms of opposites - when people display some trait, such as confidence or hypermasculinity, they are most often concealing the contrary reality. People are continually playing to the public, making a show of being progressive and saintly only to disguise their shadow. If people take an action that seems out of character: what often appears out of character is actually more of their true character. If people are essentially lazy or foolish, they leave clues to this in the smallest of details that you can pick up well before their behavior harms you. The ability to gauge people&rsquo;s true worth, their degree of loyalty and conscientiousness, is one of the most important skills you can possess.</p><h1 id=master-your-emotional-self>Master your Emotional Self<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#master-your-emotional-self>#</a></h1><p>You like to imagine yourself in control of your fate, consciously planning the course of your life as best you can. But you are unaware of how deeply you emotions dominate you. They make you veer toward ideas that soothe your ego. They make you look for evidence that confirms what you already want to believe. They make you see what you want to see, and this disconnect from reality is the source of the bad decisions and negative patterns that haunt your life. Rationality is the ability to counteract these emotional effects. It does not come naturally; it is a power we must cultivate, but in doing so we realize our greatest potential.</p><p>Rationality is not a power you are born with but one you acquire through training and practice. You are infected by all of the drama that others churn up; you are reacting to what people give you, experiencing waves of excitement, insecurity, and anxiety that make it hard to . Your attention is pulled this way and that, and without the rational standard to guide your decisions, you never quite reach the goals that you set. At any moment this can change with a simple decision. Rationality is then what you will value the most and that which will serve as your guide.</p><p>Your first task is to look at emotions that are infecting your ideas and decisions. You will begin to think for yourself instead of reacting to what others give you. Emotions tend to narrow the mind, making us focus on one or two ideas that satisfy our immediate desire for power or attention, ideas that backfire.</p><h2 id=question-yourself>Question yourself<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#question-yourself>#</a></h2><ul><li>Why this anger or resentment?</li><li>Where does this incessant need for attention come from?</li></ul><h1 id=transform-self-love-into-empathy>Transform Self-love into Empathy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#transform-self-love-into-empathy>#</a></h1><h2 id=the-law-of-narcissism>The Law of Narcissism<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-law-of-narcissism>#</a></h2><p>We possess the tool for attaining social power: empathy. When cultivated and properly used, it can allow us to see into the moods and minds of others, giving us the power to anticipate people&rsquo;s actions and lower their resistance. This instrument is blunted by our habitual self-absorption. We are all narcissists. <em>Our mission in life is to come to terms with this self-love and learn how to turn our sensitivity outward.</em></p><h2 id=the-narcissistic-spectrum>The Narcissistic Spectrum<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-narcissistic-spectrum>#</a></h2><p>we humans feel a never-ending need for attention. We are social animals to the core. Our survival and happiness depend on the bonds we form with others. If people do not pay attention to us, we cannot connect to them on any level. As those who have gone through long periods of isolation, without eye contact we begin to doubt our existence and to descend into a deep depression. Through the quality of attention we receive from others, we feel recognized and appreciated for who we are. Our sense of self-worth depends on this. People will do almost anything to get attention, including committing a crime or attempting suicide.</p><p>We face an inevitable problem: there is only so much of it to go around. We have to compete for attention. People can lbe indifferent to our fate, as they must deal with their own problems. There are some who are downright hostile and disrespectful to us. How do we handle those moments when we feel psychologically alone, or even abandoned? We can double our efforts to get attention and notice, but this can exhaust our energy and it can often have the opposite effect: people who try too hard seem desperate and repulse the attention they want.</p><p>Facing this dilemma, most of us come up with a solution: we create a self, an image of ourselves that comforts us and makes us feel validated from within. This self is composed of our tastes, our opinions, how we look at the world, what we value. <strong>In building this self-image, we tend to accentuate our positive qualities and explain away our flaws.</strong> If our self-image is too divorced from reality, other people will make us aware of the discrepancy, and we will doubt ourselves. If it is done properly, in the end we have a self that we can love and cherish. Our energy turns inward. <strong>We become the center of our attention.</strong> When we experience those moments when we are alone and not appreciated, we can retreat to this self and soothe ourselves. This self-image operates as a thermostat, helping us to regulate our doubts and insecurities. We ar eno longer dependent on others for attention and recognition. We have self-esteem.</p><p>In childhood, if narcissists are extroverts they can thrive. They become masters at attracting attention. But underneath the surface, they are addicted to the hits of attention. If they are introverts, they will retreat to a fantasy life, imagining a self that is quite superior to others. They will not get validation of this self-image from others because it is so unrealistic, they have moments of great doubt and even self-loathing. Lacking a coherent core, they could imagine themselves to be anyone. The nightmares for deep narcissists arrives in their twenties and thirties. They have failed to develop that inner thermostat, a cohesive sense of self to love and depend upon. The extroverts must attract attention to feel alive and appreciated. They become more dramatic, more exhibitionistic and grandiose. This can become tiresome and even pathetic. They have to change friends and scenes so that they can have a fresh audience. Introverts fall deeper into a fantasy self. Being socially awkward yet radiating superiority, they tend to alienate people, increasing their dangerous isolation. In both cases, addiction can become a necessary crutch to soothe them in the inevitable moments of doubt and depression.</p><p>You can recognize deep narcissists by the following behavior patterns: If they are ever insulted or challenged they have no defense, nothing internal to soothe them or validate their worth. They generally react with great rage, thirsting for vengeance, full of a sense of righteousness. This is the only way they know how to assuage their insecurities. They will position themselves as the wounded victim, confusing others and even drawing sympathy. They are prickly and oversensitive. Almost everything ist taken personally. They can become quite paranoid and have enemies in all directions to point to. You can see an impatient or distant look on their face whenever you talk about something that does not directly involve them in some way. They turn the conversation back to themselves, with some story or anecdote to distract from the insecurity behind it. They can be prone to vicious bouts of envy if they see others getting the attention the feel they deserve. They frequently display extreme self-confidence. This always helps to gain attention, and it neatly covers up their gaping inner emptiness and their fragmented sense of self. But beware if this confidence is ever truly put to the test.</p><p>When it comes to other people in their lives, deep narcissists have an unusual relationship that is hard for us to understand. They tend to see others as extensions of themselves, what is known as self-objects. People exist as instruments for attention and validation. Their desire is to control them like they control their own arm or leg. In a relationship, they will slowly make the partner cut off contact with friends: there must be no competition for attention.</p><p>Some highly talented deep narcissists manage to find some redemption through their work, channeling their energies and getting the attention they crave through their accomplishments, although they tend to remain quite erratic and volatile. Lacking the self-esteem thermostat, they are prone to worrying about what others think of them. This makes it hard to focus attention outward for long periods of time, and to deal with the impatience and anxiety that comes with work. There types tend to change jobs and careers quite frequently. This becomes the nail in their coffin: unable to attract genuine recognition through their accomplishments, they are forever thrown back on the need to artificially stimulate attention.</p><p>Deep narcissists can be annoying and frustrating to deal with; they can also become quite harmful if we get too close to them. They entangle us in their never-ending dramas and make us feel guilty if we are not continually paying them attention. Relationships with them are most unsatisfying, and having one as a partner or spouse can be deadly. The best solution in such cases is to get out of their way, once we identify them as a deep narcissist.</p><p>There is one variety of this type that is more dangerous and toxic because of the levels of power they can attain: the <em>narcissistic leader.</em> Full of narcissistic self-confidence, they attract attention and followers. they say and do things that other people don&rsquo;t dare say or do, which seems admirable and authentic. They might have a vision for some innovative product, they can find others to help them realize their vision. **They are experts at using people. **</p><p>If they have success, a terrible momentum is set in place - more people are attracted to their leadership, which only inflates their grandiose tendencies. They are hypersensitive. They also like to stir up constant drama as a means to justify their power: they are the only ones who can solve the problems they create. This also gives them more opportunities to be the center of attention. The workplace is never stable under their direction. Sometimes they can become entrepreneurs because of their charisma and ability to attract followers. They can have creative flair as well. But for many of these leader types, eventually their own inner instability and chaos will come to be mirrored in the company or group they lead. They have to control everything and everyone, their self-objects. They will proclaim this as a virtue - as being authentic and spontaneous, when in reality they lack the ability to focus and create something solid. They tend to burn and destroy whatever they create.</p><h2 id=scale-of-narcissism>Scale of Narcissism<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#scale-of-narcissism>#</a></h2><p>let us imagine Narcissism as a way of gauging the level of our self absorption as if it existed on a measurable scale from high to low. At a certain depth, let us say below the halfway mark on the scale, people enter the realm of deep narcissism. Once they reach this depth, it is very difficult for us to raise ourselves back up because we lack self-esteem device. If they engage with others, some comment or action will trigger their insecurities and they will go plummeting down. But they tend to sink deeper into themselves over time. Other people are instruments. Reality is a reflection of their needs. Constant attention is their only way of survival.</p><p>Above that halfway mark is what we shall call the functional narcissist, where most of us reside. We also are self-absorbed, but what prevents us from falling deep into ourselves is a coherent sense of self that we can rely upon and love. This creates some inner resiliency. We may have deeper narcissistic moments fluctuating below the mark, particularly when depressed or challenged in life, but inevitably we elevate ourselves. Not feeling continually insecure or wounded, not always needing to fish for attention, functional narcissists can turn their attention outward, into their work and into building relationships with people. It is ironic that the word narcissism has come to mean self-love, when it is in fact the case that worst narcissists have no cohesive self to love, when it is in fact the case that the worst narcissists have no cohesive self-love, which is the source of their problem.</p><h2 id=what-to-do-with-our-own-narcissism>What to do with our own narcissism<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-to-do-with-our-own-narcissism>#</a></h2><h3 id=understanding>Understanding<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#understanding>#</a></h3><p>We must understand the phenomenon of the deep narcissist. Although they are in the minority, some of them can inflict an unusual amount of harm in the world. We must be able to distinguish the toxic types that stir up drama and try to turn us into objects they can use for their purposes. They can draw us in with their unusual energy, but if we become enmeshed, it can be a nightmare to disengage. They are masters at turning the tables and making others feel guilty. Narcissistic leaders are the most dangerous, and we must resist their pull.</p><h3 id=our-nature>Our nature<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#our-nature>#</a></h3><p>We must be honest about our own nature and not deny it. We are all narcissists. In a conversation we are all champing at the bit to talk, to tell our story, to give our opinion. We like people who share our ideas: they reflect back to us our good taste. If we happen to be assertive, we see assertiveness as a positive quality because it is ours. Whereas timid people will rate it as obnoxious and value introspective qualities. <strong>We are all prone to flattery because of our self-love</strong> Moralizers who try to separate themselves and denounce the narcissists in the world are the biggest narcissists: they love the sound of their voice as they point fingers and preach. <em>We are all on the spectrum of self-absorption.</em> Creating a self that we can love is a healthy development, and there should be no stigma attached to it. Without self-esteem from within, we would fall into deep narcissism. But to move beyond functional narcissism, which should be our goal, we must first be honest with ourselves. Trying to deny our self-absorbed nature, trying to pretend we are somehow more altruistic makes it impossible for us to transform ourselves.</p><h3 id=healthy-narcissist>Healthy narcissist<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#healthy-narcissist>#</a></h3><p>They have a stronger, more resilient sense of self. They tend to hover closer to the top of the scale. They recover more quickly from wounds or insults. They do not need as much validation from others. They realize at some point in life that they have limits and flaws. They can laugh at these flaws and not take slights so personally. By embracing the full pictures of themselves, their self-love is more real and complete. From this stronger inner position, they can turn their attention outward more often and more easily. This attention goes in one of two directions: creative work or people.</p><p>Because their outward focus on the work is more intense, they tend to be successful in their ventures, which gives them the necessary attention and validation. They can have moments of doubt and insecurity, and artists can be brittle, but work stands as a continual release from too much much self-absorption.</p><p>The other direction is toward people, developing empathic powers. Imagine empathy as the realm lying at the very top of the scale beyond: complete absorption in others. By our very nature, we humans have tremendous abilities to understand people from the inside out. In our earliest years, we felt completely bonded with our mother, we could sense her every mood and read her every emotion in a preverbal way. Unlike any other animal or primate, we also had the ability to extend this beyond the mother to other caregivers and people in our vicinity.</p><p>The need to develop this empathy is greater than ever. Young people are more self-absorbed since the late 70s. <strong>If your attention is continually interrupted by the need to look at phones, you can never understand the feelings or perspectives of other people.</strong> You are drawn back to yourself, never really engage. <em>**Even in a crowd, you remain essentially alone. **</em> People come to serve a function - not to bond with but to placate your insecurities.</p><p>Our brains were built for continual social interaction; the complexity of this interaction is the main factors that increased our intelligence as a species. At a certain point, involving ourselves with others has a net negative effect on the brain itself and atrophies our social muscle.</p><p>You must try to fight against these developments and create empathic energy. <strong>As you tune up your empathy , you get constant positive feedback.</strong> People want to be around you more. You develop your empathic muscle; your work improves; without trying, you gain the attention that all humans thrive on. Empathy creates positive, upward momentum.</p><h2 id=empathic-skillset>Empathic skillset<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#empathic-skillset>#</a></h2><h3 id=empathic-attitude>Empathic attitude<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#empathic-attitude>#</a></h3><p><strong>The greatest danger you face is your general assumption that you really understand people and that you can quickly judge and categorize them.</strong> The people around you present a mask that suits their purposes. You mistake the mask for reality. Let go of your tendency to make snap judgments. Open your mind to seeing people in a new light. <strong>Do not assume that you are similar or that they share your values.</strong> Each person you meet is like an undiscovered country, with a very particular psychological chemistry that you will carefully explore. This flexible is similar to creative energy. Developing your empathy will also improve your creative powers.</p><p>The best place to begin this transformation is in your numerous daily conversations. Desire instead to hear the other person&rsquo;s point of view. You have tremendous curiosity in this direction. Cut off your incessant interior monologue as best you can. Give full attention to the other. <strong>What matters is the quality of your listening,</strong> so you can mirror back to the other person things they said or things that were left unsaid but that you sensed. As part of this attitude, you are giving people the same level of indulgence that you give yourself. When we make a mistake, we attribute it to circumstances that pushed us into doing it. When others make a mistake, we tend to see it as a character flaw.</p><p>Adopting this attitude <strong>depends</strong> on the quality of your self-love. If you feel terribly superior to others, or gripped by insecurities, you moments of empathy and absorption in people will be shallow. What you need is a complete acceptance of your character, including your flaws, which you can see, appreciate, and love. You are not perfect, you are not an angel. You have the same nature as others. From a position of genuine inner strength and resilience, you can more easily direct your attention outward.</p><h3 id=visceral-empathy>Visceral empathy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#visceral-empathy>#</a></h3><p>Empathy is an instrument of emotional attunement. People are continually affecting our moods. What you are doing is turning this physiological response into knowledge. When they talk, they have a feeling tone that is either in sync or not in sync with what they are saying. This tone can be one of confidence, insecurity, defensiveness, arrogance, frustration, elation. You must try to detect this before even paying attention to what they are saying. This will register to you viscerally, in your own physical response to them.</p><p>A key element you are trying to figure out is people&rsquo;s intentions. There is always an emotion behind any intention. People do shit to gain things. When we see someone smiling and in a good mood, it tends to have a contagious effect on us. <strong>Mirroring people</strong> on any level will draw out an empathic response from them. This can be physical and is known as the chameleon effect. People who are connected physically and emotionally will mimic each other&rsquo;s gestures and posture. This is why people who score high on empathy are generally excellent mimics.</p><p>Even better, you can enter the spirit of the other person. You absorb their mood deeply and reflect it back to them. You create a feeling of rapport. People crave this emotional rapport in their daily lives. It has a hypnotic effect and appeals to people&rsquo;s narcissism as you become their mirror. In practicing this type of empathy, you must maintain a degree of distance.</p><h3 id=analytic-empathy>Analytic empathy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#analytic-empathy>#</a></h3><p>The reason you are able to understand your friends or partner is that you have a lot of info about their tastes, values, and family background. We&rsquo;ve had the experience of thinking we know someone but over time having to adjust our original impression once we get more info.</p><p>There are people who we can&rsquo;t put ourselves in their shoes. Naturally we resort to judging and putting them into categories. There are people out there who are not worth the effort - supreme fools or true psychopaths. But for most others who seem hard to figure out, we should see it as an excellent challenge and a way to improve our skills.</p><blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t like that man. I must get to know him better.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Abraham Lincoln</strong></p></blockquote><p>Analytic empathy comes mostly through conversation and gathering information that will allow you to get inside the spirit of others. You want to read on people&rsquo;s values, which are mostly established in their earliest years. People develop concepts of what they consider strong, sensitive, generous, and weak often based on their parents and their relationship to them. By not understanding people&rsquo;s values, you will misread their reactions and create unnecessary conflicts.</p><p>Your goal is to gather as much as you can about the early years of the people you are studying and their relationship to their parents and siblings. Keep in mind that their current relationship to family will also speak volumes about the past. **Try to get a read on their reactions to authority figures. **This will help you see to what extent they have a rebellious or submissive streak. In general people love to talk about themselves and their past.</p><p>If people seem reluctant to talk, try asking open-ended questions, or begin with a sincere admission of your own establish trust. In general people love to talk about themselves and their past, and it is usually quite easy to get them to open up. If they come from another culture, it is important to understand this culture from within their experience. Your goal is general is to find out what makes them unique.</p><h3 id=process>Process<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#process>#</a></h3><p>You need feedback. You sense a greater rapport and how certain techniques have worked for you. The more people you interact with in the flesh, the better you will get at this. The greater the variety of people you meet, the more versatile your skill will become. In an encounter, keep your attention active to see how the other person changes over the course of a conversation and the effect you are having on them. Be alive to the moment. Try to see people as they interact with others besides you: <strong>people are often very different depending on the person they are involved with.</strong></p><p>Try to not focus on categories but on the feeling tone and mood that people evoke in you, which is continually shifting. You will notice more. Continually mix the visceral with the analytic.</p><p>Seeing improvement in your skill level will excite you greatly and motivate you to go deeper.</p><blockquote><p>The deepest principle of Human Nature is the craving to be appreciated.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>William James</strong></p></blockquote><h1 id=four-examples-of-narcissistic-types>Four examples of Narcissistic Types<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#four-examples-of-narcissistic-types>#</a></h1><p>When you listen to others, do it with such intensity and interest, that your eyes bore into your opponent. People like Stalin seemed to pick up your deepest thoughts and doubts. But his greatest trait was to make you feel important and part of the inner circle of revolutionaries. You have to create a sense that there is now a bond that link you and your opponent together forever.</p><h2 id=how-can-someone-connect-with-others-when-they-are-so-clearly-self-obsessed>How can someone connect with others when they are so clearly self-obsessed?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-can-someone-connect-with-others-when-they-are-so-clearly-self-obsessed>#</a></h2><p>These types have more ambition and energy than the average deep narcissist. They also tend to have even greater insecurities. The only way they can mollify these insecurities and satisfy their ambition is by gaining from others more than the usual share of attention and validation, which can only come through</p></div><footer class=post-footer></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://blog.banhtrang.me>baoqdau</a></span>

We bring this natural tendency to our practice of any skill. Once we grow dept at some aspect of this skill, generally one that comes more easily to us, we prefer to practice this element over and over. Our skill becomes lopsided as we avoid our weaknesses. Knowing that in our practice we can let down our guard, since we are not being watched or under pressure to perform, we bring to this a kind of dispersed attention. We tend to be also quite conventional in our practice routines. we generally follow what others have down, performing the accepted exercises for these skills.\nResistance Practice The principle is simple: you go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice.\nFirst, you resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. You become your own worst critic; you see your work as if through the eyes of others.\nYou recognize your weaknesses, precisely the elements you are not good at. Those are the aspects you give precedence to in your practice. You should find a kind of perverse pleasure in moving past the pain this might bring.\nSecond, you resist the lure of eating up on your focus. You train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity, as if it were the real thing times two.\n In devising your own routines, you become as creative as possible. You invent exercises that work on your weaknesses. You give yourself arbitrary deadlines to meet certain standards, constantly pushing yourself past perceived limits. In this way you develop your own standards for excellence, generally higher than those of others.  Apprentice yourself in Failure Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. They tell you about your own inadequacies. It is hard to find out such things from people, as people are often political with their praise and criticisms. Your failures also permit you to see the flaws of your ideas, which are only revealed in the execution of them. You learn what your audience really wants, the discrepancy between your ideas and how they affect the public. Pay close attention to the structure of your group - how your team is organized, the degree of independence you have from the source of capital. There are design elements as well, and such management issues are often hidden sources of problems.\nTwo kinds of Failure The first comes from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid, or because you are waiting for the perfect time. This kind of failure you can never learn from, and such timidity will destroy you.\nThe second kind comes from a bold and venturesome spirit. If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your reputation is greatly outweighed by what you learn. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. It is a curse to have everything go right on your first attempt. You wil fail to question the element of luck, making you think that you have the golden touch. When you do inevitably fail, it will confuse and demoralize you past the point of learning. To apprentice as an entrepreneur you must act on your ideas as early as possible, exposing them to the public, a part of you even hoping that you’ll fail. You have everything to gain.\nCombine the ‘How’ and the ‘What’ We humans live in two worlds. First, there is the outer world of appearances - all of the forms of things that captivate our eyes. But hidden from our view is another world - how these things actually function, their anatomy or composition, the parts working together and forming the whole. This second world is not so immediately captivating. It is harder to understand. It is not something visible to the eye, but only to the mind that glimpses the reality. But this ‘how’ of things is just as poetic once we understand it - it contains the secret of life, of how things move and change.\nThe division between the ‘how’ and the ‘what’ can be applied to almost everything around us - we see the machine, not how it works; we see a group of people producing something as a business, not how the group is structured or how the products are manufactured and distributed.\nIn overcoming this division, in combining the ‘how’ and the ‘what’ of architecture, we gain a much deeper, or rather more rounded knowledge of the field. He grasped a larger portion of the reality that goes into making buildings. This allowed him to create something infinitely more poetic, to stretch the boundaries, to break the conventions of architecture itself.\nScientists and technicians live in their own world, focusing mostly on the ‘how’ of things. Others live in the world of appearances, using these things but not really understanding how they function.\nJust before this split occurred, it was the ideal of the Renaissance to combine these two forms of knowledge. This is why the work of Leonardo da Vinci continues to fascinate us, and why the Renaissance remains an ideal. This more rounded knowledge is the way of the future, especially now that so much more information is available to all of us. We must make ourselves study as deeply as possible the technology we use, the function of the group we work in, the economics of our field, its lifeblood. We must constantly ask the questions - how do things work, how do decisions get made, how does the group interact?\nAdvance through Trial and Error Each age tends to create a model of apprenticeship that is suited to the system of production that prevails at the time. In the Middle Ages, during the birth of modern capitalism and the need for quality control, the first apprenticeship system appeared, with its rigidly defined terms. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the idea of developing yourself from within a particular field, as Darwin did in biology. This suited the growing spirit of the time.\nThe model goes like this: You want to learn as many skills as possible, following the direction that circumstances lead you to, but only if they are related to your deepest interests. Like a hacker, you value the process of self-discovery and making things that are of the highest quality. You avoid the trap of following one set career path. You are not sure where this will all lead, but you are taking full advantage of the openness of information, all of the knowledge about skills now at our disposal. You see what kind of work suits you and and what you want to avoid at all cost.\nYou move by trial and error. This is how you spend your twenties. You are the programmer of this wide-ranging apprenticeship, within the loose constraints of your personal interests. You are not wandering about because you are afraid of commitment, but because you are expanding your skill base and your possibilities. At a certain point, when you are ready to settle on something, ideas and opportunities will inevitably present themselves to you. In this new age, those who follow a rigid, singular path in their youth often find themselves in a career dead end in their forties, or overwhelmed with boredom.\nAbsorb the Master’s Power: the Mentor Dynamic Life is short, and your time for learning and creativity is limited. Without any guidance, you can waste valuable years trying to gain knowledge and practice from various sources. You must follow the example set by Masters throughout the ages and find the proper mentor. The mentor-protégé relationship is the most efficient and productive form of learning. the right mentors know where to focus your attention and how to challenge you. Their knowledge and experience becomes yours. They provide immediate and realistic feedback on your work, so you can improve more rapidly. Through an intense person-to-person interaction, you absorb a way of thinking that contains great power and can be adapted to your individual spirit. Once you have internalized their knowledge, you must move on and never remain in their shadow. Your goal is always to surpass your mentors in mastery and brilliance.\nWe live in a culture that likes to criticize and debunk any form of authority, to point out the weaknesses of those in power. If we feel any aura, it is in the presence of celebrities and their seductive personalities. To learn requires a sense of humility. We must admit that there are people out there who know our field much more deeply than we do. Their superiority is not a function of natural talent or privilege, but rather of time and experience.\nIf we are not comfortable with this fact, if we feel mistrustful for authority, we will succumb to the belief that we can just as easily learn something on our own, that being self-taught is more authentic. We might justify this attitude as a sign of our independence, but in fact it stems from basic insecurity. All that concern you in the early stages of your career is acquiring practical knowledge in the most efficient manner possible.\nAlmost all Masters and people of power suffer from too many demands on their time and too much information to absorb. If you can demonstrate the ability to help them organize themselves on these fronts to a degree that others cannot, it will be much easier to get their attention and interest them in the relationship. Try to see the world through their eyes and ask the simple question of what it is they need most. Keeping their self-interest involved enhance any emotional connection they feel toward you.\nIf you work on yourself first, developing a solid work ethic and organizational skills, eventually the right teacher will appear in your life. Word will spread through the proper channels of you efficiency and your hunger to learn, and opportunities will come your way. In any event, you should not feel timid in approaching Masters, no matter how elevated their position. You will be frequently surprised at how open they can be to serving as a mentor, if the fit is right and you have something to offer. The ability to transfer their experience and knowledge to someone younger often provides them with a great pleasure, akin to parenting.\nThe best mentors are often those who have wide knowledge and experience, and are not overly specialized in their field - they can train you to think on a higher level, and to make connections between different forms of knowledge.\nYou will want as much personal interaction with the mentors as possible. A virtual relationship is never enough. There are cues and subtle aspects you can only pick up through a person-to-person interaction. Tennis instructors can only reveal many secrets of their skills by demonstrating before their pupils' eyes. Instructors may not be conscious of what makes their backhand so effective, but in watching them in action pupils can pick up the pattern and motion, exploiting the power of mirror neurons. The same applies to mental jobs.\nAs the relationship progresses you can make this absorption process more conscious and direct, questioning them about the principles underlying their way of doing things. You can get them analyze their own creativity for you. They are grateful to reveal the inner workings of their power only to those they do not perceive as a threat.\nFind several mentors in your immediate environment, each one filling strategic gaps in you knowledge and experience. In our culture, we tend to venerate those who seem rebellious or at least strike the pose. But rebellion has no meaning or power if it occurs without something solid and real to rebel against. The mentor gives you just such a standard from which you can deviate and establish your own identity. You internalize the important and relevant parts of their knowledge, and you apply the knife to what has no bearing on your life.\nStrategies for deepening the Mentor Dynamic  One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\n Although you must submit to the authority of mentors in order to learn from and absorb their power to the highest degree, this does not mean you remain passive in the process.\nThe choice of the right mentor is more important than you might imagine. Because so much of her future influence upon you can be deeper than you are consciously aware of, the wrong choice can have a net negative effect upon your journey to mastery.\nTo reach mastery requires some toughness and a constant connection to reality. As an apprentice, it can be hard for us to challenge ourselves on our own in the proper way, and to get a clear sense of our own weaknesses. The times that we live in make this even harder. Developing discipline through challenging situations and perhaps suffering along the way are no longer values that are promoted in our culture. People are reluctant to tell each other the truth about themselves - their weaknesses, their inadequacies, flaws in their work.\nIt seems abusive or damaging to people’s self-esteem to offer them stern, realistic criticism, to set the tasks that will make them aware of how far they have to go.\nSpecific knowledge - Reading people You need to train yourself to pay less attention to the words that people say and greater attention to their tone of voice, the look in their eye, their body language - all signals that might reveal a nervousness or excitement that is not expressed verbally. Cutting off your interior monologue and paying deep attention, you will pick up cues from them that will register with you as feelings or sensations. Trust these sensations - they are telling you something that you will often tend to ignore because it is not easy to verbalize.\nIt is interesting to observe how people behave around those in positions of power and authority. they will reveal an anxiety, a resentment, or a sycophantic falseness that betrays something essential about their psychological makeup, something that goes back to their childhoods and that can be read in their body language.\nWhen you drop your defense mechanisms and pay deep attention to others, you will need to lower your guard and open yourself up to their influence as well. As long as your emotions and empathy are directed outward, you will be able to detach yourself when necessary and analyze what you have gleaned. Resist the temptation to interpret what they say or do as somehow implicitly involving you - this will cause you to turn your thoughts inward and close off the immediacy of the connection.\nExercise After you have known people for a while, try to imagine that you are experiencing the world from their point of view, placing yourself in their circumstances and feeling what they feel. Look for any common emotional experiences - a trauma or difficulty you’ve had, that resembles in some way what they are going through. Your ability to empathize with others is related to the creative process of feeling your way into the subject you are studying. Your goal is to figure out the hidden motives behind them, which will often revolve around power.\nIn general, you are reading and decoding every possible sign - the clothes they war and the organized or disorganized nature of their workspace. The choice of mate or partner can be quiet eloquent too, particularly if it seems slightly inconsistent with the character they try to project. In this choice they can reveal unmet needs from childhood, a desire for power and control, a low self-image, and other qualities they seek to disguise.\nWhat might seem like small issues: chronically being late, insufficient attention to detail, not returning any favors on your part, are signs of something deeper about their character. These are patterns you must pay attention to. Nothing is too small to notice. People have trained themselves to appear a certain way; they have a persona they use in public that acts like a second skin to protect them. Unless you are incredibly perceptive, you will tend to mistake the mask for the reality. Often it is the quiet ones, those who give out less at first glance, who hide greater depths, and who secretly wield greater power.\nWhat yo want is a picture of a person’s character over time, which will give you a far more accurate sense of their true character than any first impression could. So restrain yourself from the natural tendency to judge right away, and let the passing months reveal more and more about who people are, as you get better at reading them.\nYour goal is to identify and pierce through to what makes people unique, to understand the character and values that lie at their cores. the more you can fathom about people’s pasts and their way of thinking about things, the more you deeply you can enter into their spirit.\nYou will encounter thousands of various individuals in your life, and the ability to see them as they are will prove invaluable. People are in a state of continual flux. You must observe them and bring your readings of them up to date.\nSeven Deadly Realities In a group setting, there will be people who have one or more of these qualities to a high enough degree that they can become very destructive. People do not like to display these traits publicly because they are seen as ugly and undesirable.\nEnvy It is our nature to constantly ourselves to others. We will naturally experience some envy, but often we will find a way to minimize it because it is an unpleasant emotion. Seething with envy, the only way to discharge it is to find a way to obstruct or sabotage the person who elicited the emotion. Envy is very difficult to discern, and the most prudent course of action is to make sure your own behavior does not trigger it.\nIf you have a gift for a certain skill, you should make a point of occasionally displaying some weakness in other area, avoiding the great danger of appearing too perfect, too talented. If you are dealing with insecure types, you can display great interest in their work and even turn to them for advice. Self-deprecating humor will work wonders as well. In general, it is by standing out too much that you will spark this ugly emotion, and so it is best to maintain a nonthreatening exterior and to blend in well with the group, at least until you are so successful it no longer matters.\nConformism Those who are markedly different make them feel uncomfortable and insecure, calling the values of the dominant culture into question, This culture will have unwritten standards of correctness that shift with the times we live in. Often unconsciously conforming to the spirit of whoever on top, members will share the same values about morals or politics. You can become aware of this group spirit by observing how much people feel the need to display certain opinions or ideas that conform to the standards. If you have a rebellious or naturally eccentric streak, as is often the case with those who are aiming for mastery, you must be careful in displaying your different too overtly, particularly in the Apprenticeship Phase.\nLet your work subtly demonstrate your individual spirit, but when it comes to matters of politics, morals, and values, make a show of adhering to the accepted standards of your environment. Think of the workplace as a kind of theater in which you are always wearing a mask.\nRigidity When facing against complicated situations, we create habits and routines that give us a sense of control. We prefer what is familiar - ideas, faces, procedures - because they are comforting. Those who are entrenched in the old ways will fight to the death to preserve them. It is against human nature to consider alternative ways of thinking or doing things. If you are an adventurous, open-minded type, your very spirit will prove disruptive and upsetting. If you are not ware of the dangers of butting up against this fear of the new, you will create all sorts of hidden enemies, who will resort to anything to conserve the old order.\nSelf-obsessiveness We think of ourselves first. The world is a harsh and competitive place, and we must look after our own interests. Often those who are the most self-absorbed will surround their actions with a moral or saintly aura, or will make a show of supporting all of the right causes. confused by these appearances, when it is time to ask such people for assistance, you will often appeal to their sense of gratitude, their seemingly charitable nature, or their friendly feelings.\nLaziness Flightiness Passive Aggression Social intelligence All of us have social flaws of some sort, ranging from the relatively harmless to those that can get us in trouble. It could be we talk too much, or are too honest in our criticisms of people, or take offense too easily when others do no respond positively to our ideas. If we repeat bad behaviors often enough, we tend to offend people without ever really knowing why.\nFirst, we are quick to discern the mistakes and defects of others while being too emotional and insecure to look squarely at our own. People see our behavior from the outside, and their view of us is never what we imagine it to be. To have the power to see ourselves through the eyes of others would be of immense benefit to our social intelligence. We could begin to correct the flaws that offend, to see the role we play in creating any kind of negative dynamic, and to have a more realistic assessment of who we are.\nIt is best to start with events that are at least several months old, so we are not emotionally charged. We must focus on what we did that triggered or worsened the dynamic. We might begin to see a pattern that indicates a particular flaw in our character. Seeing these events from the perspective of the other people involved will loosen the lock our emotions have on our self-image, and help us understand the role we play in our own mistakes. We can also elicit opinions from those we trust about our behavior, reassure them that we want their criticisms. Slowly, we can develop increasing self-detachment, which will yield us the other half of social intelligence - the ability to see ourselves as we really are.\nCulture plays a larger role than we might imagine in how we think and communicate.\nAll of us have social flaws of some sort, ranging from the harmless to those that can get us in trouble. Talk too much, too honest in our criticism, take offense too easily. We are quick to discern the mistakes and defects of others, but we get too emotional and insecure to look at our own. People rarely tell us the truth about what it is that we do wrong. It becomes very difficult for us to perceive our flaws, let alone correct them.\nTo have the power to see ourselves through the eyes of others would be of immense benefit to our social intelligence. We could begin to correct the flaws that offend. Seeing these events from the perspective of the other people involved will loosen the lock our emotions have on our self-image, and help us understand the role we play in our own mistakes. We can develop increasing self-detachment, which will yield us the other half of social intelligence: the ability to see ourselves as we really are.\nFools We can classify people as fools by the following rubric: they place more importance on short-term matters - grabbing immediate money, getting attention from the public or media, and looking good. They are ruled by their ego and insecurities. They tend to enjoy drama and political intrigue for their own sake. They are more interested in their career and position than in the truth. You can distinguish them by how little they get done, or by how hard they make it for others to get results. They lack a certain common sense, getting worked about things that are not really important while ignoring problems that will spell doom in the long term. The natural tendency with fools is to lower yourself to their level. They annoy you, get under your skin, and draw you into a battle. In the process, you feel petty and confused. You lose a sense of what is really important. You can’t win an argument or get them to see your side or change their behavior, because rationality and results don’t matter to them. You simply waste valuable time and emotional energy.\nIn dealing with fools you must adopt the following philosophy: they are simply a part of life, like rocks or furniture. All of us have foolish sides, moments in which we lose our heads and think more of our ego or short-term goals. It is human nature. Seeing this foolishness within you, you can accept it in others. This will allow you to smile at their antics, to tolerate their presence as you would a silly child, and to avoid the madness of trying to change them. It is all part of the human comedy, and it is nothing to get upset about or lose sleep over. This attitude - “Suffer Fools Gladly” - should be forged in your Apprenticeship Phase, during which you are almost certainly going to encounter this type. If they are causing you trouble, you must neutralize the harm they do by keeping a steady eye on your goals and what is important, and ignoring them if you can.\nWhen it comes to practical life, what should matter is getting long-term results, and getting the work done in as efficient and creative a manner as possible. It is wise to try to gain the rudiments of social intelligence - to be able to read and recognize the sharks, and to charm and disarm difficult people. Your conscious attempt to opt out of the system will retard your apprenticeship in social intelligence and can make you vulnerable to the worst forms of naivete.\n It is a great folly to hope that other men will harmonize with us; I have never hoped this. I have always regarded each man as an independent individual, whom I endeavored to understand with all his peculiarities, but from whom I desired no further sympathy. In this way have I been enabled to converse with every man, and thus alone is produced the knowledge of various characters and the dexterity necessary for the conduct of life.\n  JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE\n Awaken the dimensional mind Masters and those who display a high level of creative energy are people who manage to retain a sizeable portion of their childhood spirit despite the pressures and demands of adulthood. This spirit manifests itself in their work and in their ways of thinking. Children are naturally creative. They transform everything around them, play with ideas and circumstances, and surprise us with the novel things they say or do.\nMaster not only retain the spirit of the Original Mind, but they add to it their years of apprenticeship and an ability to focus deeply on problems or ideas. This leads to high-level creativity. Although they have profound knowledge of a subject, their minds remain open to alternative ways of seeing and approaching problems. Like children, they are capable of thinking beyond words - visually, spatially, intuitively - and have greater access to preverbal and unconscious forms of mental activity, all of which can account for their surprising ideas and creations.\nSome people maintain their childlike spirit and spontaneity, but their creative energy is dissipated in a thousand directions, and they never have the patience and discipline to endure an extended apprenticeship. Others have the discipline to accumulate vast amounts of knowledge and become experts in their field, but they have no flexibility of spirit, so their ideas never stray beyond the conventional and they never become truly creative. Such a mind is not constricted by limited experience or habits. The Dimensional Mind is active, transforming everything it digests into something new and original, creating instead of consuming. What kills the creative force is not age or a lack of talent, but our own spirit, our own attitude. We become too comfortable with the knowledge we have gained in our apprenticeships. We prefer to live with familiar ideas and habits of thinking, but we pay a steep price for this: our minds go dead from the lack of challenge and novelty; we reach a limit on our field and lose control over our fate because we become replaceable.\nPrerequisites One, a high level of knowledge about a field or subject; and two, the openness and flexibility to use this knowledge in new and original ways. The knowledge that prepares the ground for creative activity largely comes from a rigorous apprenticeship in which we have mastered all of the basics. The problem of us all is that the knowledge we gain in the Apprenticeship Phase can become a prison. It locks us into certain methods and forms of thinking that are one-dimensional. Instead, the mind must be force from its conservative positions and made active and exploratory.\nChoose the proper Creative Task, the kind of activity that will maximize our skills and knowledge.\nLoosening and opening up the mind through Creative Strategies\nCreate the optimal mental conditions for a Breakthrough or Insight\nBe aware of the Emotional Pitfalls: complacency, boredom, grandiosity, and the like.\nCreative task Alter your concept of creativity by truing to see it from a new angle. Creative activity is one that involves the entire self: our emotions, our levels of energy, our characters, and our mind. This requires time and effort. This often entails years of experimentation, setbacks and failures, and the need to maintain a high level of focus.\nThe task you choose to work on must have an obsessive element. Your emotional commitment to what you are doing will be translated directly into your own work.

We bring this natural tendency to our practice of any skill. Once we grow dept at some aspect of this skill, generally one that comes more easily to us, we prefer to practice this element over and over. Our skill becomes lopsided as we avoid our weaknesses. Knowing that in our practice we can let down our guard, since we are not being watched or under pressure to perform, we bring to this a kind of dispersed attention. We tend to be also quite conventional in our practice routines. we generally follow what others have down, performing the accepted exercises for these skills.</p><h1 id=resistance-practice>Resistance Practice<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#resistance-practice>#</a></h1><p>The principle is simple: you go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice.</p><p>First, you resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. You become your own worst critic; you see your work as if through the eyes of others.</p><p>You recognize your weaknesses, precisely the elements you are not good at. Those are the aspects you give precedence to in your practice. You should find a kind of perverse pleasure in moving past the pain this might bring.</p><p>Second, you resist the lure of eating up on your focus. You train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity, as if it were the real thing times two.</p><ul><li><strong>In devising your own routines, you become as creative as possible.</strong></li><li>You invent exercises that work on your weaknesses. You give yourself arbitrary deadlines to meet certain standards, constantly pushing yourself past perceived limits. In this way you develop your own standards for excellence, generally higher than those of others.</li></ul><h1 id=apprentice-yourself-in-failure>Apprentice yourself in Failure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apprentice-yourself-in-failure>#</a></h1><p>Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. They tell you about your own inadequacies. It is hard to find out such things from people, as people are often political with their praise and criticisms. Your failures also permit you to see the flaws of your ideas, which are only revealed in the execution of them. You learn what your audience really wants, the discrepancy between your ideas and how they affect the public. Pay close attention to the structure of your group - how your team is organized, the degree of independence you have from the source of capital. There are design elements as well, and such management issues are often hidden sources of problems.</p><h2 id=two-kinds-of-failure>Two kinds of Failure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#two-kinds-of-failure>#</a></h2><p>The first comes from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid, or because you are waiting for the perfect time. This kind of failure you can never learn from, and such timidity will destroy you.</p><p>The second kind comes from a bold and venturesome spirit. If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your reputation is greatly outweighed by what you learn. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. It is a curse to have everything go right on your first attempt. You wil fail to question the element of luck, making you think that you have the golden touch. When you do inevitably fail, it will confuse and demoralize you past the point of learning. To apprentice as an entrepreneur you must act on your ideas as early as possible, exposing them to the public, a part of you even hoping that you&rsquo;ll fail. You have everything to gain.</p><h2 id=combine-the-how-and-the-what>Combine the &lsquo;How&rsquo; and the &lsquo;What&rsquo;<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#combine-the-how-and-the-what>#</a></h2><p>We humans live in two worlds. First, there is the outer world of appearances - all of the forms of things that captivate our eyes. But hidden from our view is another world - how these things actually function, their anatomy or composition, the parts working together and forming the whole. This second world is not so immediately captivating. It is harder to understand. It is not something visible to the eye, but only to the mind that glimpses the reality. But this &lsquo;how&rsquo; of things is just as poetic once we understand it - it contains the secret of life, of how things move and change.</p><p>The division between the &lsquo;how&rsquo; and the &lsquo;what&rsquo; can be applied to almost everything around us - we see the machine, not how it works; we see a group of people producing something as a business, not how the group is structured or how the products are manufactured and distributed.</p><p>In overcoming this division, in combining the &lsquo;how&rsquo; and the &lsquo;what&rsquo; of architecture, we gain a much deeper, or rather more rounded knowledge of the field. He grasped a larger portion of the reality that goes into making buildings. This allowed him to create something infinitely more poetic, to stretch the boundaries, to break the conventions of architecture itself.</p><p>Scientists and technicians live in their own world, focusing mostly on the &lsquo;how&rsquo; of things. Others live in the world of appearances, using these things but not really understanding how they function.</p><p>Just before this split occurred, it was the ideal of the Renaissance to combine these two forms of knowledge. This is why the work of Leonardo da Vinci continues to fascinate us, and why the Renaissance remains an ideal. This more rounded knowledge is the way of the future, especially now that so much more information is available to all of us. We must make ourselves study as deeply as possible the technology we use, the function of the group we work in, the economics of our field, its lifeblood. We must constantly ask the questions - how do things work, how do decisions get made, how does the group interact?</p><h1 id=advance-through-trial-and-error>Advance through Trial and Error<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#advance-through-trial-and-error>#</a></h1><p>Each age tends to create a model of apprenticeship that is suited to the system of production that prevails at the time. In the Middle Ages, during the birth of modern capitalism and the need for quality control, the first apprenticeship system appeared, with its rigidly defined terms. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the idea of developing yourself from within a particular field, as Darwin did in biology. This suited the growing spirit of the time.</p><p>The model goes like this: You want to learn as many skills as possible, following the direction that circumstances lead you to, but only if they are related to your deepest interests. Like a hacker, you value the process of self-discovery and making things that are of the highest quality. You avoid the trap of following one set career path. You are not sure where this will all lead, but you are taking full advantage of the openness of information, all of the knowledge about skills now at our disposal. You see what kind of work suits you and and what you want to avoid at all cost.</p><p>You move by trial and error. This is how you spend your twenties. You are the programmer of this wide-ranging apprenticeship, within the loose constraints of your personal interests. You are not wandering about because you are afraid of commitment, but because you are expanding your skill base and your possibilities. At a certain point, when you are ready to settle on something, ideas and opportunities will inevitably present themselves to you. In this new age, those who follow a rigid, singular path in their youth often find themselves in a career dead end in their forties, or overwhelmed with boredom.</p><h1 id=absorb-the-masters-power-the-mentor-dynamic>Absorb the Master&rsquo;s Power: the Mentor Dynamic<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#absorb-the-masters-power-the-mentor-dynamic>#</a></h1><p>Life is short, and your time for learning and creativity is limited. Without any guidance, you can waste valuable years trying to gain knowledge and practice from various sources. You must follow the example set by Masters throughout the ages and find the proper mentor. The mentor-protégé relationship is the most efficient and productive form of learning. the right mentors know where to focus your attention and how to challenge you. Their knowledge and experience becomes yours. They provide immediate and realistic feedback on your work, so you can improve more rapidly. Through an intense person-to-person interaction, you absorb a way of thinking that contains great power and can be adapted to your individual spirit. Once you have internalized their knowledge, you must move on and never remain in their shadow. Your goal is always to surpass your mentors in mastery and brilliance.</p><p>We live in a culture that likes to criticize and debunk any form of authority, to point out the weaknesses of those in power. If we feel any aura, it is in the presence of celebrities and their seductive personalities. To learn requires a sense of humility. We must admit that there are people out there who know our field much more deeply than we do. Their superiority is not a function of natural talent or privilege, but rather of time and experience.</p><p>If we are not comfortable with this fact, if we feel mistrustful for authority, we will succumb to the belief that we can just as easily learn something on our own, that being self-taught is more authentic. We might justify this attitude as a sign of our independence, but in fact it stems from basic insecurity. All that concern you in the early stages of your career is acquiring practical knowledge in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>Almost all Masters and people of power suffer from too many demands on their time and too much information to absorb. If you can demonstrate the ability to help them organize themselves on these fronts to a degree that others cannot, it will be much easier to get their attention and interest them in the relationship. Try to see the world through their eyes and ask the simple question of what it is they need most. Keeping their self-interest involved enhance any emotional connection they feel toward you.</p><p>If you work on yourself first, developing a solid work ethic and organizational skills, eventually the right teacher will appear in your life. Word will spread through the proper channels of you efficiency and your hunger to learn, and opportunities will come your way. In any event, you should not feel timid in approaching Masters, no matter how elevated their position. You will be frequently surprised at how open they can be to serving as a mentor, if the fit is right and you have something to offer. The ability to transfer their experience and knowledge to someone younger often provides them with a great pleasure, akin to parenting.</p><p>The best mentors are often those who have wide knowledge and experience, and are not overly specialized in their field - they can train you to think on a higher level, and to make connections between different forms of knowledge.</p><p>You will want as much personal interaction with the mentors as possible. A virtual relationship is never enough. There are cues and subtle aspects you can only pick up through a person-to-person interaction. Tennis instructors can only reveal many secrets of their skills by demonstrating before their pupils' eyes. Instructors may not be conscious of what makes their backhand so effective, but in watching them in action pupils can pick up the pattern and motion, exploiting the power of mirror neurons. The same applies to mental jobs.</p><p><strong>As the relationship progresses you can make this absorption process more conscious and direct, questioning them about the principles underlying their way of doing things. You can get them analyze their own creativity for you. They are grateful to reveal the inner workings of their power only to those they do not perceive as a threat.</strong></p><p>Find several mentors in your immediate environment, each one filling strategic gaps in you knowledge and experience. In our culture, we tend to venerate those who seem rebellious or at least strike the pose. But rebellion has no meaning or power if it occurs without something solid and real to rebel against. The mentor gives you just such a standard from which you can deviate and establish your own identity. You internalize the important and relevant parts of their knowledge, and you apply the knife to what has no bearing on your life.</p><h1 id=strategies-for-deepening-the-mentor-dynamic>Strategies for deepening the Mentor Dynamic<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#strategies-for-deepening-the-mentor-dynamic>#</a></h1><blockquote><p>One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil.</p><p><strong>Friedrich Nietzsche</strong></p></blockquote><p>Although you must submit to the authority of mentors in order to learn from and absorb their power to the highest degree, this does not mean you remain passive in the process.</p><p>The choice of the right mentor is more important than you might imagine. Because so much of her future influence upon you can be deeper than you are consciously aware of, the wrong choice can have a net negative effect upon your journey to mastery.</p><p>To reach mastery requires some toughness and a constant connection to reality. As an apprentice, it can be hard for us to challenge ourselves on our own in the proper way, and to get a clear sense of our own weaknesses. The times that we live in make this even harder. Developing discipline through challenging situations and perhaps suffering along the way are no longer values that are promoted in our culture. People are reluctant to tell each other the truth about themselves - their weaknesses, their inadequacies, flaws in their work.</p><p>It seems abusive or damaging to people&rsquo;s self-esteem to offer them stern, realistic criticism, to set the tasks that will make them aware of how far they have to go.</p><h1 id=specific-knowledge---reading-people>Specific knowledge - Reading people<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#specific-knowledge---reading-people>#</a></h1><p>You need to train yourself to pay less attention to the words that people say and greater attention to their tone of voice, the look in their eye, their body language - all signals that might reveal a nervousness or excitement that is not expressed verbally. Cutting off your interior monologue and paying deep attention, you will pick up cues from them that will register with you as feelings or sensations. Trust these sensations - they are telling you something that you will often tend to ignore because it is not easy to verbalize.</p><p>It is interesting to observe how people behave around those in positions of power and authority. they will reveal an anxiety, a resentment, or a sycophantic falseness that betrays something essential about their psychological makeup, something that goes back to their childhoods and that can be read in their body language.</p><p>When you drop your defense mechanisms and pay deep attention to others, you will need to lower your guard and open yourself up to their influence as well. As long as your emotions and empathy are directed outward, you will be able to detach yourself when necessary and analyze what you have gleaned. Resist the temptation to interpret what they say or do as somehow implicitly involving you - this will cause you to turn your thoughts inward and close off the immediacy of the connection.</p><h2 id=exercise>Exercise<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#exercise>#</a></h2><p>After you have known people for a while, try to imagine that you are experiencing the world from their point of view, placing yourself in their circumstances and feeling what they feel. Look for any common emotional experiences - a trauma or difficulty you&rsquo;ve had, that resembles in some way what they are going through. Your ability to empathize with others is related to the creative process of feeling your way into the subject you are studying. Your goal is to figure out the hidden motives behind them, which will often revolve around power.</p><p>In general, you are reading and decoding every possible sign - the clothes they war and the organized or disorganized nature of their workspace. The choice of mate or partner can be quiet eloquent too, particularly if it seems slightly inconsistent with the character they try to project. In this choice they can reveal unmet needs from childhood, a desire for power and control, a low self-image, and other qualities they seek to disguise.</p><p><strong>What might seem like small issues: chronically being late, insufficient attention to detail, not returning any favors on your part,</strong> are signs of something deeper about their character. These are patterns you must pay attention to. Nothing is too small to notice. People have trained themselves to appear a certain way; they have a persona they use in public that acts like a second skin to protect them. Unless you are incredibly perceptive, you will tend to mistake the mask for the reality. Often it is the quiet ones, those who give out less at first glance, who hide greater depths, and who secretly wield greater power.</p><p>What yo want is a picture of a person&rsquo;s character over time, which will give you a far more accurate sense of their true character than any first impression could. So restrain yourself from the natural tendency to judge right away, and let the passing months reveal more and more about who people are, as you get better at reading them.</p><p>Your goal is to identify and pierce through to what makes people unique, to understand the character and values that lie at their cores. the more you can fathom about people&rsquo;s pasts and their way of thinking about things, the more you deeply you can enter into their spirit.</p><p>You will encounter thousands of various individuals in your life, and the ability to see them as they are will prove invaluable. People are in a state of continual flux. You must observe them and bring your readings of them up to date.</p><h1 id=seven-deadly-realities>Seven Deadly Realities<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#seven-deadly-realities>#</a></h1><p>In a group setting, there will be people who have one or more of these qualities to a high enough degree that they can become very destructive. People do not like to display these traits publicly because they are seen as ugly and undesirable.</p><h2 id=envy>Envy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#envy>#</a></h2><p>It is our nature to constantly ourselves to others. We will naturally experience some envy, but often we will find a way to minimize it because it is an unpleasant emotion. Seething with envy, the only way to discharge it is to find a way to obstruct or sabotage the person who elicited the emotion. Envy is very difficult to discern, and the most prudent course of action is to make sure your own behavior does not trigger it.</p><p>If you have a gift for a certain skill, you should make a point of occasionally displaying some weakness in other area, avoiding the great danger of appearing too perfect, too talented. If you are dealing with insecure types, you can display great interest in their work and even turn to them for advice. Self-deprecating humor will work wonders as well. In general, it is by standing out too much that you will spark this ugly emotion, and so it is best to maintain a nonthreatening exterior and to blend in well with the group, at least until you are so successful it no longer matters.</p><h2 id=conformism>Conformism<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conformism>#</a></h2><p>Those who are markedly different make them feel uncomfortable and insecure, calling the values of the dominant culture into question, This culture will have unwritten standards of correctness that shift with the times we live in. Often unconsciously conforming to the spirit of whoever on top, members will share the same values about morals or politics. You can become aware of this group spirit by observing how much people feel the need to display certain opinions or ideas that conform to the standards. If you have a rebellious or naturally eccentric streak, as is often the case with those who are aiming for mastery, you must be careful in displaying your different too overtly, particularly in the Apprenticeship Phase.</p><p>Let your work subtly demonstrate your individual spirit, but when it comes to matters of politics, morals, and values, make a show of adhering to the accepted standards of your environment. Think of the workplace as a kind of theater in which you are always wearing a mask.</p><h2 id=rigidity>Rigidity<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rigidity>#</a></h2><p>When facing against complicated situations, we create habits and routines that give us a sense of control. We prefer what is familiar - ideas, faces, procedures - because they are comforting. Those who are entrenched in the old ways will fight to the death to preserve them. It is against human nature to consider alternative ways of thinking or doing things. If you are an adventurous, open-minded type, your very spirit will prove disruptive and upsetting. If you are not ware of the dangers of butting up against this fear of the new, you will create all sorts of hidden enemies, who will resort to anything to conserve the old order.</p><h2 id=self-obsessiveness>Self-obsessiveness<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#self-obsessiveness>#</a></h2><p>We think of ourselves first. The world is a harsh and competitive place, and we must look after our own interests. Often those who are the most self-absorbed will surround their actions with a moral or saintly aura, or will make a show of supporting all of the right causes. confused by these appearances, when it is time to ask such people for assistance, you will often appeal to their sense of gratitude, their seemingly charitable nature, or their friendly feelings.</p><h2 id=laziness>Laziness<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#laziness>#</a></h2><h2 id=flightiness>Flightiness<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#flightiness>#</a></h2><h2 id=passive-aggression>Passive Aggression<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#passive-aggression>#</a></h2><h1 id=social-intelligence>Social intelligence<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#social-intelligence>#</a></h1><p>All of us have social flaws of some sort, ranging from the relatively harmless to those that can get us in trouble. It could be we talk too much, or are too honest in our criticisms of people, or take offense too easily when others do no respond positively to our ideas. If we repeat bad behaviors often enough, we tend to offend people without ever really knowing why.</p><p>First, we are quick to discern the mistakes and defects of others while being too emotional and insecure to look squarely at our own. People see our behavior from the outside, and their view of us is never what we imagine it to be. To have the power to see ourselves through the eyes of others would be of immense benefit to our social intelligence. We could begin to correct the flaws that offend, to see the role we play in creating any kind of negative dynamic, and to have a more realistic assessment of who we are.</p><p>It is best to start with events that are at least several months old, so we are not emotionally charged. We must focus on what we did that triggered or worsened the dynamic. We might begin to see a pattern that indicates a particular flaw in our character. Seeing these events from the perspective of the other people involved will loosen the lock our emotions have on our self-image, and help us understand the role we play in our own mistakes. We can also elicit opinions from those we trust about our behavior, reassure them that we want their criticisms. Slowly, we can develop increasing self-detachment, which will yield us the other half of social intelligence - the ability to see ourselves as we really are.</p><p>Culture plays a larger role than we might imagine in how we think and communicate.</p><p>All of us have social flaws of some sort, ranging from the harmless to those that can get us in trouble. Talk too much, too honest in our criticism, take offense too easily. We are quick to discern the mistakes and defects of others, but we get too emotional and insecure to look at our own. People rarely tell us the truth about what it is that we do wrong. It becomes very difficult for us to perceive our flaws, let alone correct them.</p><p>To have the power to see ourselves through the eyes of others would be of immense benefit to our social intelligence.

They are ruled by their ego and insecurities. They tend to enjoy drama and political intrigue for their own sake. They are more interested in their career and position than in the truth. You can distinguish them by how little they get done, or by how hard they make it for others to get results. They lack a certain common sense, getting worked about things that are not really important while ignoring problems that will spell doom in the long term. The natural tendency with fools is to lower yourself to their level. They annoy you, get under your skin, and draw you into a battle. In the process, you feel petty and confused. You lose a sense of what is really important. You can&rsquo;t win an argument or get them to see your side or change their behavior, because rationality and results don&rsquo;t matter to them. You simply waste valuable time and emotional energy.</p><p>In dealing with fools you must adopt the following philosophy: they are simply a part of life, like rocks or furniture. All of us have foolish sides, moments in which <strong>we lose our heads and think more of our ego or short-term goals</strong>. It is human nature. <em>Seeing</em> this foolishness within you, you can accept it in others. This will allow you to smile at their antics, to tolerate their presence as you would a silly child, and to avoid the madness of trying to change them. It is all part of the human comedy, and it is nothing to get upset about or lose sleep over. This attitude - &ldquo;Suffer Fools Gladly&rdquo; - should be forged in your Apprenticeship Phase, during which you are almost certainly going to encounter this type. If they are causing you trouble, you must neutralize the harm they do by keeping a steady eye on your goals and what is important, and ignoring them if you can.</p><p>When it comes to practical life, what should matter is getting long-term results, and getting the work done in as efficient and creative a manner as possible. It is wise to try to gain the rudiments of social intelligence - to be able to read and recognize the sharks, and to charm and disarm difficult people. Your conscious attempt to opt out of the system will retard your apprenticeship in social intelligence and can make you vulnerable to the worst forms of naivete.</p><blockquote><p>It is a great folly to hope that other men will harmonize with us; I have never hoped this. I have always regarded each man as an independent individual, whom I endeavored to understand with all his peculiarities, but from whom I desired no further sympathy. In this way have I been enabled to converse with every man, and thus alone is produced the knowledge of various characters and the dexterity necessary for the conduct of life.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE</p></blockquote><h1 id=awaken-the-dimensional-mind>Awaken the dimensional mind<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#awaken-the-dimensional-mind>#</a></h1><p>Masters and those who display a high level of creative energy are people who manage to retain a sizeable portion of their childhood spirit despite the pressures and demands of adulthood. This spirit manifests itself in their work and in their ways of thinking. Children are naturally creative. They transform everything around them, play with ideas and circumstances, and surprise us with the novel things they say or do.</p><p>Master not only retain the spirit of the <em>Original Mind,</em> but they add to it their years of apprenticeship and an ability to focus deeply on problems or ideas. This leads to high-level creativity. Although they have profound knowledge of a subject, their minds remain open to alternative ways of seeing and approaching problems. Like children, they are capable of thinking beyond words - visually, spatially, intuitively - and have greater access to preverbal and unconscious forms of mental activity, all of which can account for their surprising ideas and creations.</p><p>Some people maintain their childlike spirit and spontaneity, but their creative energy is dissipated in a thousand directions, and they never have the patience and discipline to endure an extended apprenticeship. Others have the discipline to accumulate vast amounts of knowledge and become experts in their field, but they have no flexibility of spirit, so their ideas never stray beyond the conventional and they never become truly creative. Such a mind is not constricted by limited experience or habits. The Dimensional Mind is active, transforming everything it digests into something new and original, creating instead of consuming. What kills the creative force is not age or a lack of talent, but our own spirit, our own attitude. We become too comfortable with the knowledge we have gained in our apprenticeships. We prefer to live with familiar ideas and habits of thinking, but we pay a steep price for this: our minds go dead from the lack of challenge and novelty; we reach a limit on our field and lose control over our fate because we become replaceable.</p><h2 id=prerequisites>Prerequisites<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#prerequisites>#</a></h2><p>One, a high level of knowledge about a field or subject; and two, the openness and flexibility to use this knowledge in new and original ways. The knowledge that prepares the ground for creative activity largely comes from a rigorous apprenticeship in which we have mastered all of the basics. The problem of us all is that the knowledge we gain in the Apprenticeship Phase can become a prison. It locks us into certain methods and forms of thinking that are one-dimensional. Instead, the mind must be force from its conservative positions and made active and exploratory.</p><p>Choose the proper <em>Creative Task,</em> the kind of activity that will maximize our skills and knowledge.</p><p>Loosening and opening up the mind through <em>Creative Strategies</em></p><p>Create the optimal mental conditions for a <em>Breakthrough</em> or <em>Insight</em></p><p><strong>Be aware</strong> of the <em>Emotional Pitfalls:</em> complacency, boredom, grandiosity, and the like.</p><h2 id=creative-task>Creative task<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#creative-task>#</a></h2><p>Alter your concept of creativity by truing to see it from a new angle. Creative activity is one that involves the entire self: our emotions, our levels of energy, our characters, and our mind. This requires time and effort. This often entails years of experimentation, setbacks and failures, and the need to maintain a high level of focus.</p><p>The task you choose to work on must have an obsessive element. Your emotional commitment to what you are doing will be translated directly into your own work. If you are doi something primarily form money and without a real emotional commitment, it will translate into something that lacks a sould and that has no connection to you.</p><p>First, the task that you choose must be realistic.

filter for\n  attention overload as a serious problem\n  we’re expected to do shadow work - the work of the companies for them.\n     have you ever sat in an airplan or train, just staring out the window with nothing to read, looking at nothing in particular? you might have found that time passed pleasantly.\n  you might have had a smilar feeling the last time you sat by the ocean or a lake, leeting your mind wander, and experiencing the relaxing feeling it induced. in this state, thoughts move seamlessly from one to another, there’s a merging of ideas, visual images, and sounds, of past, present, and future. thoughts turn inward - loosely connected, stream-of-consciousness thoguhts so much like the nighttime dream state that we call them daydreams\n  ths special brain state is marked by the flow of connections among disparate ideas and thoguhts, and a relative lack of barriers between sense and concepts. this network exerts a pull on consciousnessl it eagerly shifts the brain into mind wandering when\n  its discovery - a special brain network that supports a more fluid and nonlinear mode of thinking\n  it has taken over when you find you’ve been reading several pages in a book without registering their content, or when you are driving on a long stretch of highway and suddenly realize you havent' been paying attention to where you are and you missed your exit.\n  if you’ve ever stopped what you were doing to picture the conseunce of some future action or to imagine yourself in a particular future encounter, maybe your eyes turned up or down in your head from a normal straight-ahead gaze, and you became preoccupied with thought.\n  this is the default mode. this mode is a resting brain state, when your brain is not evnaged in a purposeful task. it’s not just that you can’t hold on to any one thought from the rolling stream, it’s that no single thought is demanding a response.\n  when you’re intensely focused on a task such as doing your taxes.\n  there are two brain states form a kind of yin-yang: when one is active, the other is not. during demanding tasks, the central executive kicks in,.\n  the phrase paying attention is a well-worn figurative language. atention has a cost. in a zero-sum game. we pay attention to one thing, either through conscious decision or because our attentional filter deemed it important enough to push it to the forefront of attentional focus.\n  people have focused on mapping the parts of the brain with different activities: tennis, music, perform mathematical calcualtions.\n  language ability does not reside in a specific region of the brain; it comprises a distributed network. the mind-wandering mode works in opposition to the central executive mode: when one is activated, the other is deactivated.\n  in our mind-wandering mode, our thoughts are mostly directed inward to our goals, desires, feelings, plans, and also our relationship with other people. there is a clear evolutionary advantage to beinbg able to stay on task and concentrate, we can switch\n  the orbital and prefrontal areas are responsible for things like planning, scheduling, and impulse control, and the supplementary motor area is responsible for initiating movement.\n  the inner dialuge is generated by the planning centers of your brain in the prefontal cortex, and the questions are being answered by other parts of your brain that possess the info\n  consciousness is a continuum of different states. the more accurate neural descriptions is that many networks of neurons are firing, much like the network of telephones simultaneously ringing in a busy office.\n  if you’re driving along and your thoguhts start to wander, this is the system that snaps to when a large truck suddenly crosses over into your lane, and gives you a shot of adrenaline at the same time.\n  ADHD drugs can block noreadrenaline release, and in turn block your alerting to warning signals\n  if you’re a sonar operator in asubmarine, you want your alerting system to be function at full capacity.\n  where memory comes from   parts of the brain can fall asleep for a few moments or longer without our realizing it. at any given moment,\n  many things get lost when we are not attending to the moment putting them down. to train ourselves to a zen-like focus living in the moment, of paying attention to whenever we put things down or put things away.\n  theory: many memories we’ve experienced are in there.\n memory is unreliable because the untrained brain has a crappy filling system. it takes everything that happens to you and throws it all willy-nilly into a big dark cloest.\n  when we experience any event, a nuique network of neurosn is activated depending on the nature of the event. neurons fire for face recognition for the players , motion detection for the movements of their bodies the act of remembering something is a process of bringing back on line those neurons that ere involved in the original experience. once we get those neurons to become active in a fashion similar to how thery were dying the original event, we experience the memory as lower-resolution replay of the original event. the remembering is imperfect: the instructions for which neurons need to be gathered and how exactly they need to fire are weak and degraded, leading to a simulacrum of the real experience.    thus our memory tends to be poor most of the time, not because the limited capacity of our brains to store the info but because of the nature moemory retrieval,\n  the biggest problem in humanity is that we dont know when were recalling things inaccurately. of often have a strong feeling of certainty that accompanies an incorrect, distorted memory. the more we can externalize memory throught physical records outthereintheworld, the less we must rely on our overvonfident, underprecise memoryu.\n  the best remembered- experiences are disinctive/unique or have a strong emotional component.\n  the reason why it is difficult to remember what you ate for breakfast two thursdays ago is that there is nothing special about that breakfast.\n  memory retrieval requires our brains to sift throught mutlille, competing instances to pick out just the ones we are trying to recollect.\n  having breakfast served to you in bed on your twenty-first birthday by a new, naked, romantic partner is even more unusual.\n  we need to remember unique or disintivive events because theyu represnet a potential change in the world around us or our undretstanding of it.\n  if something made us incredibly frightrend, elated, sad, or angry: we are more likely to remember it.\n  fuzzy categories are instantiated biologically in the brain, being able to create, use, and understand both kinds of categoes is something that our brains are hardwired to do.\n  people at the top of their professions, in particular those known for their creativity and effectiveness, use system of atttention and memory external to their brain as much as they can. a lot of the muse low tech solution for keeping on top of things..\n  when alen made a big list of everthing that was on his mind, he felt more lexaed and better able to focus on his work. if an boligation remained recorded only mentally. some part of me constantly kept thinking that it should be attended to, creating a situation that was inherntly stressful and unproductive.\n  the constant nagging in your mind of\n  your brain needs to engage on some consistent basis with all of your commitments activitites.\n  small tasks  the brain we need to rely on for staying on task is easily distracted multitasking activates the reward-seeking centers of the brain, casusing a burst of endogenous opioids little decisions take up as much energy as big ones. one of the first things we lose is impulse control. after making lots of insignificant decisions, we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important we are sacrificing efficiency and deep concentration when we interrupt our priority activities with email. we feel a sense of accomplishment after doing small tasks. the secret is to put systems in place to trick ourselves into staying on task when we need them to. experts receommend that you do email only two or three times a day. in concerted clumps rather than as they.  pratical   3 x 5 system\n  one idea or task per card. this ensures that you can easily find it and dispose of it when it’s been dealth with. one piee of information per card allows for rapid sorting and resorting.\n  the idea of the index cards, makes them preferable to fullsize sheets of paper because they provide greater random access.\n  once you have a stack, you make it a point to sort them regularly .\n  the names of categories arent imporant. its the pricess f external categorization.\n  if you can attend to one of the things on your list in less than two minutes do it now. if a task can be done by someone else. delegate it. anything that takes more than two mintes, defer.\n  you can keep these things all in your brain. but not effective.\n  people who use the index card system find it liberating.\n  some of the best ideas you’ll have come tin when youre doing something unrelated. you dont need to carry all the cards with you everywhere of course. priorities change and the rndom access nature of thecards means you can put them whenver they will be the most useful.\n  category  do it delegate it defer it drop it  organizing our homes affordances  simple affordances for the objects of our lives can rapidly ease the mental burden of trying to keep track of where they are. whenever you are home, that is where they keys should be. the big rules in not losing things is the rule of the designated place. spend as much as you can on decor that holds things. affordances if youll forget to buy milk on the way home, put an empty milk carton on the seat next to you in the car or in the backpack you carry to work on the subway. the brain is an exquisite change detector if the umbrella is by the door all the time, rain or shine, it no longer functions as  rules  1: a mislabeled item or location is worse than an unlabeled item if there is an existing standard, use it dont keep what you cant use  digital home  create different desktop patterns so visual cues help to remind you. if you’re working on two comletely separte projects, dedicate one desk or table of the house for each. stepping into a different space hits the reset button on your brain and allows for more productive and creative thinking computer: you can keep your files entirely unorganized and the search function will help you find them instantly. the price is that you have to register and recall every filename you’ve ever used. organization shouldnt be the same for everybody.  filing cabinet  alphebetizing my folders wihin categories dont spend more time filing and classifying than you’ll reap on searching what do you love about being at home. that feeling of calm, secure control over how you spend your time.  iphone  swiss army appliance that include a dict, calc, blah. were not multitasking, were just switching back and forth quickly. everytime we switch,theres a cognitive overhead.  stay in touch with a vast array of friends   set a frequency you want to meet them. when the reminder ges off. you send them a text to check in.\n  external memory that includes other people is known as transactive memory, that includes the knowledge of who in your social network possesses the knowledge you seek.\n  a large part of organizing our social world successfully is identifying what we want from it. most of us want to feel that we fit in somewhere and art part of a group.\n  being alone for too long causes neurochemical changes that can result in hallucinations, depression, suicidal thoughts, violent behaviors, and even psychosis.\n  social isolation is also a risk factor for cardiac arrest and death.\n  although many of us think we prefer being alone, we dont know what we want.\n  there is comfort in belonging\n  our brains carry around a vestigial primordial longing to know where all these people in our lives ended up\n  we dont keep up with people whom we dont like or whose relevance to our lives diminish over time.\n  theres an illusion in all of this. social networking provides breadth but no depth. the online interaction works best as a supplement, not a replacement for inperson contact.\n  women are more focused than men on commitment and continuity of communication.\n  men on sexual and physical closeness\n  intimacy, love, and passion dont always go together - they belong to different multidimensional constructs\n  we have an innate tendency to deceive when it is in our own self-interest.\n  intimacy is a new thing. many of us ask more than ever of our romantic partners. we expect them to be there for emotional support, companionship, intimacy, and financil support, and we expect at various times they will function as confidante, nurse, sounding board, secretary, treasurer, parent, protector, guide, cheerleader, masseuse, and throught it all we expect them to be consistently alluring, sexully appealing, and to stay in lockstep with our own sexual appetites and preferences. we expect our partners to help us achive our full potential in life.\n  our increased desire for our partners to do all these things is rooted in a biological need to conenct deeply with at least one other person. when it is missing, making such a connection becomes a high priority. when that need is fulfilled by a satisfying intimate relationship, the benefits are both psychological and physiiological. people in a relationship experience better health, recover from illnesses more quickly, and live longer.\n  the presence of a satisfying intimate relationship is one of the strongest predictors of happiness and emotional well-being that has ever been measured. how do we enter into and maintain intimate relationships.\n  to be agreeable is to be cooperative, friendly, considerate, and helpful - attributes that are more or less stable across the lifetime, and show up early in childhood. we can control undesirable emotions such as anger and frustration.\n  children who receive positive reinforcement for impulse control and anger management become agreeable adults. being an aggreable person is a tremendous advantage for maintaing positive social relationships.\n   having a best friend during adolescence is an important part of becoming a well-adjusted adult. those without one are more likely to be bullied and marginalized and to carry these experiences into becoming a disagreeable adults.    having an aggreeable friend also protects social problems later in life.\n  on average, marriage partners tend to be similar in age, education level, and attractiveness.\n  the internet has helped some of us to become more social and to establish and maintain a larger number of relationships. for others, particularly heavy internet users who are introverted to begin with, the internet has led them to become less socially involved, lonelier, and more likely to become depressed. theres is a dramatic decline in empathy among college students. who apparently are far less likely to say that it is valuable to put oneself in the place of others or to try and understand their feelings. its because were spending more time alone under the illusion that theyr being social.\n  this streamlined access to a pool of thoudsands of potential partners can elicit an evaluative, assessment-oriented mindset that leads online daters to objectify potential partners and might even undermine their willingness to commit to one of them.\n  it can also cause people to make lazy, ill-advised deciosn due to cognitive and decision overload. consumers cant keep track of more than two or three variables of interest when evaluating a large number of alternatives. this is directly related to the capacity limitations of working memory.\n  its also related limitations of our attentional network. when considering dating alternatives, we need to get our minds to shuttle back and forth between the central executive mode: keeping track of all those little details, and the daydreaming mode: what our life would be like with them in our life, the mode in which we try to picture oursevles with each of the attractive alternatives.\n  that rapid switching between central executive calculating and dreamy mind0wandering depletes neural resources, leading us to make poor decisions. when cognitive resources are low, we have difficulty focusing on relevant information and ignoring the irrelevant.\n  staying in any commited monogamous relationship requires fidelity, or forgoing the forbidden fruit. this is known to be a function of the availability of attractive alternatives. stories of people who forgot to take their dating profile down after meeting and beginning a serious relationship with someone are legion.\n  online daters engage in deception.\n  once we are in a relationship, romantic or platonic, how well do know the people we care about. and how good are we at knowing their thoughts?\n  people lie for reasons: fear of reprisal, avoiding hurting other people’s feelings, whitelies to minimize antogonism. we are good at telling when people are lying and we go along with it.\n  a large part of social interaction requires that we subdue our innate primate hostilities in order to get along. one way of helping to keep learge numbers of humans living close proximity is through the use of nonconfrontational speech, or indirect speech acts. indirect speech acts dont say what we actually want, but they imply it. they are called implicatures\n  indirect speech acts are a powerful social glue that enables us to get along. the act of uttering an idirect speech act can be seen as inherently an act of play, an invitation to cooperate in a game of verbal hide-and-seek ‘do you understand what im saying?’ they invoke in both the speaker and the hearer a shared representation of the world; they rely on shared background info that is both linguistic and social. by appealing to their shared knowledge, the speaker and listener are creating a pact and affirming their shared worldview.\n  social rejection causes activation in the same part of the brain as physical pain does. tylenol can reduce people’s experience of social pain.\n  the set of utterances that can so change the state of the world is limited, but they are powerful. we empower these legal or quasi-legal authorities in order to facilitate our understanding of the social world.\n  theres a hormone in the brain released by the back half of the pituitary gland, oxytocin. when a person has an orgasm, oxytocin is released, and of the effects of oxytocin is to make us feel bonded to others.\n  nature’s way of causing couples to want to stay together after sex to raise any children that might result from that sex. it is clearly an evolutionary advantage for a child to have two caring, nurturing parents. if the parents feel bonded to each other through oxytocin release, they are more likely to share in the raising of their children, thus propagating their tribe\n  oxytocin in idividuls with autism shows up at lower than normal levels, and the administration of oxytocin causes them to become more social, and improves emotion recognition.\n  oxytocin creates a feeling of trust\n  people who receive social support during illness recover more fully and more quickly.\n  levels of oxytocin also increase during gaps in social support or poor social functioning.\n  oxytocin regulates the salience of social information and is capable of eliciting positive and negative social emotions. its role is to organize social behavior.\n  nondrug therapies, such as music, may exert similar therapeutic effects via oxytocinergic regulation. music has been shown to increase oxytocin levels, esp when people listen to or play music together.\n  a related chemical in the brain, a protein called arginine vasopressin, regulate affiliation, sociability, and courtship.\n  vasopressin causes some murine species to behave ‘polygamously’\n  active ingredient marijuana activates cannabinoid receptors, which increases social activity\n  LSD stimulate dopamine and certain serotonine receptors\n  in order to feel socially connected to others, we like to think we know them, and to some extent we can predict their behavior.\n    we have a tendency to describe the people we know in trait terms: theyre extroverts or introverts, agreeable or not, the life of the party or stickinthemud in social psychology experiments. funcdamental attribution error: an additional part of the fundamental attribution error is that we fail to appreciate the roles people are forced to play in certain situations constrain their behavior. suppose youre walking down the halls of your office and pass a new coworker. you say hello and he doesnt respond. you could atribute his bahavior to a stable personality trait nd conclude that he is shy or that he is rude. or you could attribute his bahavior to a situational factor. the more cognitive load one is experiencing, the more likely one is to make errors in judgement about the causes of an individual’s bahavior.  on the edge of your social world  we tend to have a very difficult time ignoring info that has been shown later to be false. humans gossip for many reasons: it helps us feel suoerior to others when we otherwise feel insecure about ourselves. if tiffany is willing to join in the gossip with me against britney. humans tend to be innately suspicious of outsiders where and outsider is anyone different from us: religion, skin color, hometowm, the school from which we graduated, our income level, the political party we belong to, the kinds of music we listen to, highschoolers typically break into dozens of subcliques based on further partitioning of what constitutes people like us. this partitioning arises at a time when our brains and bodies are undergoing dramatic neural and hormonal changes. we tend to oversestimate the similarities of outgroup members a group will be perceived differently, and more accurately, by its own members than by outsiders ingroup and outgroup effects have a neurobiological basis. within an area of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex, theres a group of neurons that fire when we think about ourselves and poeple who are like us. due to exposure. were better able to engage the medial prefrontal cortex with ingroup members because their bahaviors are easier for our brains to visualize in all their nuance. it appears that the partitioning of people into mutually exclusive categories activates the perception that ‘we’ are better than ‘they’ even when there is no rational basis for it. thats just the way ‘we’ are when we think about organizing our social world, the implication of ingroup/outgroup bias is clear. we have a stubborn tendency to misjudge outsiders and diminish our abilities to forge new, cooperative, and potentially valuable social relations. racism is a form of negative social judgement that arises from a combination of belief perseverance, outgroup bias, categorization error, and faulty inductive reasoning. in case of ingroup/outgroup bias, each group thinks of the other as homogeneous and monoithic, and each group views itself as variegated and complex the act of living in cities and towns together is an act of cooperation. various levels of gov pass laws to define civil behavior. we rely on each other not just to observe the law but to be basically helpful and cooperative beyond the law. social interactions are complex and a number of experiments have demonstrated that we tend either to act in our own self interest or just plain dont want to get involved. the tendency to not get involved is driven by three powerful, interrelated psychological principles.   strong desire to confrom to others' behavior in the hope that it will allow us to gain acceptance within our social group. to be seen as cooperative and agreeable. social comparison: we tend to examine our bahavior in terms of others diffusion of responsibility. natural and ingrained feelings about equity and wanting to punish freeloaders.   we are nost just a social species but often a selfish one. what is the neurochemical mechanism that supports this altruistic sentinel behavior. oxytocin - the same social affilitive hormone that increases trust and social cooperation among humans. try to be agreeable.  organizing our time   prefrontal cortex. more highly developed than other species. seed of many behaviors we consider distinctly human: logic, analysis, problem solving, good judgement, planning for the future, decision making.\n  CEO of the brain. extensive two-way connections between the prefrontal cortex and almost every other region of the brain place it in a unique position to schedule, monitor, manage, and manipulate nearly every activity we undertake.\n  one of the great achievements of the human prefrontal cortex is that it provides us with impulse control and the ability to delay gratification, something that most animals lack. children and adolescents are not good at planning or delaying gratification\n  dysexecutive syndrome: planning and time coordination deficits. utter lack of inhibition across a range behaviors, particularly in social settings. blurt out inappropriate remarks, go on binges.\n  if your inhibitions are reduced, youre impaired at seeing the future consequences of your actions. you tend to do\n  damage to the prefrontal cortex causes an inability to effectively go forward or backward in time in one’s mind. we get stuck in the present, doing something over and over again, perseverating, revealing a failure in temporal control.\n  they can be terrible at organizing their calendars and todo lists due to a double whammy of neural deficits. first, theyre unable to place events in the correct temporal order.\n  if you dont know you have it. youre liabke to go headlong into situations without taking proper precautions and end up in trouble.\n  advanced prefrontal cortex damage interferes\n  with the ability to make connections and associations between disparate thoguhts and concepts, resulting in a loss of creativity. esp important for generating creative acts in art and music. this is the region of the brain that is most active when creative artists are functioning at their peak.\n  most of us live in a goldilocks zone where everything is just right. thats when weplan our activities, follow through on our plans, and inhibit impulses that would take us off track.\n  the brain coordinates a large share of the body’s housekeeping and timekeeping functions - regulating heart rate and blood pressure, signaling whent its time to sleep and wake up, letting us know when were hungry or full, and maintaining body temperature even as the outside temperature changes.\n  higher cognitive functions of the brain handled by the cerebral cortex: reasoning, problem solving, language, music, precision athletic movement, mathematical ability, art, and the mental operations that support them: meory attention, perception, motor palnning, and categorization.\n  n=1 experiment playing music to an owl: neural firing pattern the same pattern of beats and ptiches that were in the original music\n  this includes relatively well-known neurochemicals: serotonin, dopamin, oxytocin, epinephrine, as well as acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, and endocannabinoids. chemicals are released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of info in the brain.\n  manufacturing these chicals, and dispersing them to regulate and modulte brain activity, requires energy: they get that energy from glucose. no other tissue in the body relies solely on glucose for energy except the testes.\n  eating or drinking glucose. chronic ingestion of sugars. can damage other systems and lead to diabetes and sugar crash.\n  the brain burns glucose as a car burns gasoline, fuel to mental operations.\n  most brain energy is used in synptic transmission in conneting neurons to one another and in turn connecting thoughts and ideas to one another.\n  the brain only takes in the world little bits and chunks at a time.\n  the brain picks and chooses and acticipates what it thinks is goin to be important, what you should pay attention to.\n  people who organize their time in a way that allows them to focus are going to get more done, less tired and less neurochemically depeted after doing it. daydreaming takes less energy than multitasking. multitasking by definition disrupts the kind of sustain thought needed for problem sovling and for creativity.\n  multitasking is bad for innovation. brain’s arousal system has a novelty bias, meaning that its attention can be hijacked easily by something new: humans will work as hard to obtain a novel experience as we will to get a meal or a mate.\n  the very brain region we need to rely on for stayin on task is easily distracted by shiny new objects.\n  in multitasking, we unknowingly enter anaddiction loopp as the brain’s novelty centers become rewarded for processing shiny new stimuli, to the detriment of our prefrontal cortex, which wants to stay on task and gain the rewards of sustained effort and attention.\n  trdeoff in multitasking comes down to focus vs creativity.\n  we consider a discovery to be creative if it explores new ideas through analogy, metaphor, or tying together things that we didnt realize were connected.\n  individuals who take dopamine-enhancing drugs such as methylphenidate report that it helps them to stay motivated to work, to stay focused, and to avoid distractions.\n  interesting gene: COMT. appears to modulate the ease with which people can switch tasks, by regulating the amount of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.\n  low dopamines in the prefrontal cortex: greater cognitive flexibility, easier task switching, more creativity than average.\n  high dopamne levels:less cognitive flexibility, difficulty task switching. many people who have ADD are more creative and that those who can stay very focused on task might be excelennt workers when following instructions but are not esp. creative.\n  prefrontal cortex damage: can lead to deficits both in event segmentation.\n  when we do complex tasks. our prefrontal cortex works with our hippocamus to build an ensemble of mental images of the finished outcome alongside mental mimages of the partly finished outcomes. also subconsciously picture what would happen if we did things out of order.\n  chunk  if i have something big i want to get done, break it into chunks: meaningful, implementable, doable chunks. theres the balance between doing and monitoring your progress. we work, we inspect the wor, we make adjustments, we push forward. the prefrontal cortex coordinates the compariosn of whats out there and whats in our head. we must constantly go back and forth between work and evaluation, comparing the ideal image in our head with the owkr in front of us. many many phd students fall into this categoru. never finishing their degrees because they cant move forward. planning and doing require separate parts of the brain. to be both a boss and a worker, one needs to form and maintain multiple ordered attentional sets and then bounce back and forth between them. it forms an executive attentional set for a task and then constructs a worker attentional set for doing the actual task the exec set cares only that the job is done and well. the worker gets down to we the mop and start the job. a good worker will be able to call uopn a level of attention subordinate to all that and momentarily become a kind of detail-oriented worker. if we dont plan, we might have to make high level decisions. all this level shifting, exec to worker, is a shifting of the attentional set and it comes with the metabolic cost of multitasking. by dividing up the roles in, workers dont have to gaf.  worker mode.  if you have chores to do, put similar chores together if clean house, just clean house. stay focused and maintain a single attentional set through to completion of a job. organizing our mental resources efficiently means providing slots in our schedules. allows us to get more done and finish up with more energy,  sleep  bimodal sleep: 2 rounds of sleep. first round of sleep occur 4 or 5 hours after dinner. followed by an awake period of one or more hours in the middle of the night. followed by a second period of four or five hours of sleep. bimodal sleep nap regime is healthier and promotes greater life satisfaction efficiency and performance. caffeine enhances cognitive function. but it only works best when ypu’ve bee nmaintaining a cosistent sleep pattern over many days and weeks. as a substitute for lost sleep. it may keep you awake, but it will not keep you alert or performing at peak ability. sleeping pills are trash medication-induced sleep quality is poor = memory consolidation is affected. cues to regulate sleep-wake cycle: light. bright light in the orning signals the hypothalamus to release chemicals that help us wake up: cortisol, adrenaline.  tips  go to bed at the same time every nightwake up at the same time every morning set an alarm clock if you have to stay up late one night. still wake up at a fixed time in the next morning. sleep in a cool, dark room. cover your windows if needed to keep out light.  naps  naps: beautiful, scrumptious, very much needed for worn-out neural circuits. naps longer than 40 mins are counterproductive. dont naps after hitting the snooze button or close to actual sleep time powernaps yield significant cognitive enhancement, improvement in memory, and increased productivity.  procrastinate  do the most unpleasant task the first thing in the morning to get it out of the way. willpower deplets as the day moves on. procrastination is a failure of self-regulation, planning, impulse control, or a combination of all 3. the tendency to procrastinate has been found to be correlated with certain traits, lifestyles, and other factors. younger and single are more likely to procrastinate. being outside in natural settings: parks, forests, the beach, the mountains, and the desert. replenished self-regulatory mechanisms in the brain. living or spending time in nature as opposed to urban environments reduce the tendency to procrastinate selective migration: large urban centers are associated with critical thinking and and creativity, and also procrastination. the increased bombardment of sensory info reduces the ability to enter the daydreaming mode, the mode that replenished the exec attention system. is there a brain region implicated in procrasination. procrastination resembles some of the temporal planning deficits we saw following prefrontal damage.  types  some of us procrastinate difficult or unpleasant tasks in favor of those that are more fun. others pursue unpleasant task in favor of those that are more fun or that yield an immediate reward.   the rest seeking procrastinators would generally rather not be exerting themselves at all. while the fun-task procrastinators enjoy being busy and active all the time. delayed gratification: activities with a long time to completion (long time to reward) are the ones more likely to be started late. and those with an immediate reward are less likely to be procrastinated humans have a low tolerance for frustration. when choosing what tasks to undertake or activities to pursue, we tend to choose not the most rewarding but the easisest. this means that unpleasant or difficult things get put off.   we tend to evaluate our self-worth in terms of our achievements. whether we lack self-confidence in general: or confidence that this particular project will turn out well. we procrastinate because that allows us to delay putting our reputations on the line until later.\n why?  our limbic system, and immediate-rewards-seeking parts of the brain contest with our prefrontal cortex. which all too well understands that consequenes of falling behind. both regions run on dopamine. but the dopamine has different actions in each. dopamine in the prefrontal cortex causes us to focus and stay on task. dopamine in the limbic system, along with the brain’s own endogenous opioids, causes us to feel pleasure. we put things off wehenver the desire for immediate pleasure wins out over our ability to delay gratification, depending on which dopamine system is in control some individuals suffer from initiaion deficits: cant start others fail to accomplish tasks on time because they cant finish maybe because of the lack of skills. maybe from perfectionism.  mindset  successful person sees each setback as an opportunity to gain additional knowlege to accomplish my goal success: ‘i thought i knew everything i needed to know to achieve my goals. but this has taught me that i dont. once i learn this, i can get back on track.’ they expect a rocky life ahead. 2 subregions involved in self-assessment and judging own performance are dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the orbital cortex. self-confidence appears to have a genetic basis.   faulty beliefs  life should be easy our self-worth is dependent on our success if our self-confidence and the value of completing the task are both high, we’re less likely to procrastinate.  $$ \\textbf{procrastination } = \\frac{\\text{time to complete a task x distractability} }{\\text{self-confidence x task value}} $$\ncreativity  achieving insight across a wide variety of problems. first we focus all our attention on the aspects of the problem is it is presented (combing through different possible solutions and scenarios with our left prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate) second phase, we need to relax, let go of the problem, and let networks in the right hemisphere take over neurons in the right hemisphere are more broadly tuned, with longer branches and more dendritic spines. less precise but more connected. the moment preceding insight is accompanied by a burst of gamma waves. which bind together disparate neural networks, effectivelt binding thoughts that were seemingly unrelated into a coherent new whole.  maximize creativity  flow state: different state of being during flow, two key regions of the brai ndeactivate: the portion of the prefrontal cortex responsible for self-criticism, and the amygdala, the brain’s fear center.  flow state  attention is focused on a limited perceptual field, and that field receives your full concentration and complete investment action and awareness merge.you cease thinking about yourself as separate from the activity or the world, and you don’t think of your actions and your perceptions as being distinct: what you think becomes what you do. during flow, you experience freedom from worry about failure; you are aware of what needs to be done, but you don’t feel that you are doing it. the ego is not involved and falls away completely. flow is a lack of distractibility: the same old distractions are there, but we’re not tempted to attend to them. we monitor our performance without the kinds of self-defeating negative judgments flow states don’t occur for just any old task or activity. they can occur only when one is deply focused on the task, when the task requires intense concentration and commitment, provides immediate feedback, and is perfectly matched to one’s skill level if the task you are engaged in is too simple, holding no challenge, i’ll get bored. that boredom will break my attention to the task, and my mind will wander into the default mode. if the task is too difficult and holds too many challenges. i’ll become frustrated and experience anxiety. the greater my skill is, the greater the opportunity to achieve flow. the flow state is characterized by a total lack of conscious awareness, am erging of your self with the project itself, a seamless melding of thought, action, movment, and result. the higher your skill level, the more easily you can practive those skills automatically, subconsciously, and then the more easily you can disengage your conscioys mind, your ego, and other enemies of flow. easier for those who have invested a great deal of time to a given dopamin  what flow means  high level of engagement. info access and processing seem effortless. skills we didn’t know we had emerges. with no need to exercise self-control to stay focused, we free neural resources to the task at hand. during flow states, we no longer need to exert ourselves to stay on task: it happens automatically as we enter this specialized attentional state. it takes less energy to be in flow than to be distracted. this is why flow states are periods of great productivity and efficiency flow is a chemically different state. flow occurs when you are not explicitly thinking about what you’re doing. your brain is in a special mode of activity in which procedures and operations are performed automatically without your having to exert conscious control. trying to think about what you’re doing can quickly interferem ending the automaticity and high performance level you’ve enjoyed.  flow can be disruptive  can become an addiction.  deep shit  when we think about our lives as a whole, we think whether we feel we made any contributions with our lives.   distractions  if you really need to get something done, give it to a busy person. a large part of efficient time management revolves around avoiding distractions an ironic part of life is that we are harmed by the things we desire the temptations that can disrupt our lives are pure indulgences. realizing when a diversion has gotten out of control is one of the great challenges of life. anything that tempts us to break the greatest life satisfaction comes from completing projects that require sustained focus and energy. to ignore distractions, we have to trick ourselves, or create system that helps us stick to the work two kinds of distractions we need to deal with are external and internal.  external  set aside a particular time of day to work. adopt the mental set that this thing you’re doing now is the most important thing you could be doing we have to rely on our own wits, and on the prefrontal cortex’s central executive. difficult tasks benefit from a sustainede period of concentration of fifty minutes or more, due to the amount of time it takes to settle into and maintain a focused state. best time-management technique is to ensure you have captured every single thing that has your attention, or should have your attention, by writing it down. then you can step back and look at your list from an observer standpoint and not let yourself be drivent by what’s the latest and loudest in your head. taking breaks is also important. getting up to walk around at least once every ninety minutes.  five-minute rule  things you can deal with now are better off being dealt with, rather than letting them accumulate. set aside a designated block of time to deal with all these little things.  calculate my time worth  do not spend more time on a decision than its worth.  organizing info for the hardest decisions  we’re faced with decisions every day that impact our livelihood, our happiness, and our health.  thinking straight about probabilities  cognitive science has taught us that relying on our gut or intuition often leads to bad decisions, esp. in cases where statistical info is avaialble part of maintaining an organized mind and orgnized life requires that we make the best decisions possible. bad decisions sap strength and energy.  categories of decision-making  easy decisions delegatable decisions decisions which you have all the relevant

Decision making is often very rapid, outside our conscious control, and involves heuristics and cognitive impulses that have evolved to serve us in a wide range of situations. Rationality in decision making is partly ilusory. humans are social creatures, and most of us unconsciously modify our behavior to minimize conflict with those around us. organizations that discuss ethics openly create a culture of adhering to ethical norms because it is ‘what everyone does around here’ organizations that allow employees to ignore ethics form a breeding ground for bad behavior   Last lesson  The greatest scientists are artists as well. When I examine myself and my methods of thought. I come close to the conclusion that the gift of imagination has meant more to me than any talent for absorbing absolute knowledge… ll great achievements of science must start from intuitive knowledge. I believe in intuition and inspiration…At times I feel certainI am right while not knowing the reason. -Einstein -\n  It’s usually obvious when you’re talking to somebody a level above you, because they see lots of things instantly when those things take considerable work for you to figure out. They remember what it’s like to struggle in the place where you’re struggling, but the things they do still make sense from your perspective. getting organized can bring us all to the next level in our lives it’s the human condition to fall prey to old habits. we must look at areas of our lives that need cleaning up, and then proactively do so. the key to change is having faith that when we get rid of the old, something or someone even more magnificent will take its place   ","wordCount":"7665","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/images/organized-mind.jpeg","datePublished":"2020-12-05T15:00:24-05:00","dateModified":"2020-12-05T15:00:24-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"baoqdau"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/learn/organized-mind/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"baoqdau","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.banhtrang.me accesskey=h title="baoqdau (Alt + H)"><img src=/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>baoqdau</a>

new thing. many of us ask more than ever of our romantic partners. we expect them to be there for emotional support, companionship, intimacy, and financil support, and we expect at various times they will function as confidante, nurse, sounding board, secretary, treasurer, parent, protector, guide, cheerleader, masseuse, and throught it all we expect them to be consistently alluring, sexully appealing, and to stay in lockstep with our own sexual appetites and preferences. we expect our partners to help us achive our full potential in life.</p></li><li><p>our increased desire for our partners to do all these things is rooted in a biological need to conenct deeply with at least one other person. when it is missing, making such a connection becomes a high priority. when that need is fulfilled by a satisfying intimate relationship, the benefits are both psychological and physiiological. people in a relationship experience better health, recover from illnesses more quickly, and live longer.</p></li><li><p>the presence of a satisfying intimate relationship is one of the strongest predictors of happiness and emotional well-being that has ever been measured. how do we enter into and maintain intimate relationships.</p></li><li><p>to be agreeable is to be cooperative, friendly, considerate, and helpful - attributes that are more or less stable across the lifetime, and show up early in childhood. we can control undesirable emotions such as anger and frustration.</p></li><li><p>children who receive positive reinforcement for impulse control and anger management

consumers cant keep track of more than two or three variables of interest when evaluating a large number of alternatives. this is directly related to the capacity limitations of working

mode: keeping track of all those little details, and the daydreaming mode: what our life would be like with them in our life, the mode in which we try to picture oursevles with each of the attractive alternatives.</p></li><li><p>that rapid switching between central executive calculating and dreamy mind0wandering depletes neural resources, leading us to make poor decisions. when cognitive resources are low, we have difficulty focusing on relevant information and ignoring the irrelevant.</p></li><li><p>staying in any commited monogamous relationship requires fidelity, or forgoing the forbidden fruit. this is known to be a function of the availability of attractive alternatives. stories of people who forgot to take their dating profile down after meeting and beginning a serious relationship with someone are legion.</p></li><li><p>online daters engage in deception.</p></li><li><p>once we are in a relationship, romantic or platonic, how well do know the people we care about. and how good

are called implicatures</p></li><li><p>indirect speech acts are a powerful social glue that enables us to get along. the act of uttering an idirect speech act can be seen as inherently an act of play, an invitation to cooperate in a game of verbal hide-and-seek &lsquo;do you understand what im saying?&rsquo; they invoke in both the speaker and the hearer a shared representation of the world; they

Intense negative thinking always accompanies a depressive episode, or any painful emotion for that matter.\n Every time I become depressed, I feel as if I have been hit with a sudden cosmic jolt, and begin to see things differently. The change can come within less than an hour. My thoughts become negative and pessimistic. As I look into the past, I become convinced that everything that I’ve ever done is worthless. Any happy period seems like an illusion. I become convinced that the real me is worthless and inadequate. I can’t move forward with my work because I become frozen with doubt. But I can’t stand still because the misery is unbearable.\n The negative thoughts that flood your mind are the actual cause of your self-defeating emotions. These thoughts are what keep you lethargic and make you feel inadequate. Your negative thoughts are the most frequently overlooked symptoms of your depression. Every time you feel depressed about something, try to identify a corresponding negative thought you had just prior to and during the depression. These thoughts have actually created your bad mood, by learning to restructure them, you can change your mood.\nIf your understanding of what is happening is accurate. If your perception is twisted and distorted in some way, your emotional response will be abnormal.\nCognitive Distortions Overview of Cognitive Distortions\n         All-or-nothing thinking You see things in black-and-white. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.   Overgeneralization You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.   Mental filter You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively   Disqualifying the positive You reject positive experiences by insisting they “don’t count.”   Jumping to conclusions You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion: a. Someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don’t bother to check this out. b. You anticipate that things turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an already-established fact.   Magnification or Minimization You exaggerate the importance of things (your failures) or shrink things (your achievements) until they appear tiny.   Emotional Reasoning You assume negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are   Should Statements You try to motivate yourself with should statements. As if you have to be whipped and punished before you could do anything. The emotional consequence is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others, you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.   Labeling and Mislabeling An extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: “I’m a loser.” When someone else’s behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him. Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.   Personalization You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which you were not primarily responsible for.    All-or-nothing thinking Tendency to evaluate your personal qualities in extreme, black-or-white categories. It causes you to fear any mistake or imperfections because you will then see yourself as a complete loser, and you will feel inadequate and worthless.\nThis way of evaluating things in unrealistic because life is rarely one way or the other. No one is absolutely brilliant or totally stupid. Similarly, no one is either completely attractive or totally ugly. This type of perceptual error is ‘dichotomous thinking.’ You see everything as black or white - shades of grey do not exist.\nOvergeneralization The pain of rejection is generated almost entirely from overgeneralization.\nMental filter You pick out a negative detail in any situation and dwell on it exclusively, thus perceiving that the whole situation is negative. When you are depressed, you wear a pair of eyeglasses with special lenses that filter out anything positive. All that you allow to enter your conscious mind is negative.\nDisqualifying the positive Transform neutral or even positive experiences into negative ones. An everyday example of this would be the way most of us have been conditioned to respond to compliments.\nThe hypothesis that dominates your depressive thinking is some version of “I’m second rate” Whenever you have a negative experience, you dwell on it and conclude, “That proves what I’ve known all along” When you have a positive experience, you tell yourself, “That wa a fluke. It doesn’t count.”\nWhile this type of cognitive distortion is commonplace, it can also form the basis for some of the most extreme forms of depression.\nJumping to conclusions Mind reading Make the assumption that other people look down on you and you’re so convinced about this that you don’t even bother to check it out. You may respond to these imagined negative reactions by withdrawal or counterattack. This self-defeating behavior pattern may act as a self-fulfilling prophecy and set up a negative interaction.\nFortune teller error You imagine that something bad is about to happen, and you take this prediction as a fact even though it is unrealistic.\nMagnification and Minimization You look at things out of proportion. You diminish your strengths and magnify your imperfections or problems.\nEmotional Reasoning This kind of reasoning is misleading because your feelings reflect your thoughts and beliefs.\n        I feel overwhelmed and hopeless. Therefore my problems must be impossible to solve.   I feel inadequate. Therefore, I must be a worthless person.   I’m not in the mood to do anything. Therefore I might as well just lie in bed.   I’m mad at you. This proves that you’ve been acting rotten and trying to take advantage of me.   I feel like a dud, therefore I am a dud    Emotional reasoning plays a role in nearly all your depressions. Because things feel negative to you, you assume they truly are. It doesn’t occur to you to challenge the validity of the perceptions that create your feelings.\nOne usual side effect of emotional reasoning is procrastination. You avoid cleaning yp your desk because you tell yourself you can’t do it. Six months later you finally give yourself a little push and do it. It turns out to be gratifying and not so tough at all.\nShould statements You motive yourself by saying “I should do this” or “I must do that.” These statements pressure and make you feel resentful. You end up feeling apathetic and unmotivated.\nShould statements generate a lot of unnecessary emotional turmoil in your daily life. When the reality of your own behavior falls short of your standards, your shoulds and shouldn’ts create self-loathing, shame, and guilt. When the all-too-human performance of other people fall short of your expectations, as will inevitably happen from time to time, you’ll feel bitter and self-righteous.\nLabeling and Mislabeling Creating a completely negative self-image based on your errors. It is an extreme form of overgeneralization. The philosophy behind it is “The measure of a man is the mistakes he makes.”\nWhen you describe your mistakes with sentences beginning with “I’m a…”\nLabeling yourself is not only self-defeating, it is irrational. Your self cannot be equated with any one thing you do. Your life is a complex and ever-changing flow of thoughts, emotions, and actions. To put it another way, you are more like a river tha na statue. Stop trying to define yourself with negative labels - they are overly simplistic and wrong. This is nonsense, but such nonsense becomes painful when you label yourself out of a sense of your own inadequacies.\nWhen you label other people, you will generate hostility.\nMislabeling involves describing an event with words that are inaccurate and emotionally heavily loaded.\nPersonalization This distortion is the mother of guilt. You assume responsibility for a negative even when there is no basis for doing so. You arbitrarily conclude that what happened was your fault or reflects your inadequacy even when you were not responsible for it.\nPersonalization causes you to feel crippling guilt. You suffer from a sense of responsibility that forces you to carry the whole world on your shoulders. You have confused influence with control over others.\nStart by building Self-esteem When you are depressed, you believe that you are worthless. The worse the depression, the more you feel this way. Depressed patients see themselves as deficient in qualities they value most highly: intelligence, achievement, popularity, attractiveness, health, and strength.\nAlmost all negative emotional reactions inflict their damage only as a result of low self-esteem. If you are depressed or have ever been depressed, you may find it much harder to recognize the illogical thinking patterns which cause you to look down on yourself. You are probably convinced that you really are inferior or worthless.\nWhen you are depressed you may not be alone in your conviction about your personal inadequacy. In many cases you will be so persuasive and persistent in your maladaptive belief that you are defective and no good, you may lead your friends, family, and even your therapist into accepting this idea of yourself. For many years psychiatrists have tended to ‘buy into’ the negative self-evaluation system of depressed individuals without probing the validity of what the patients are saying about themselves. Freud argued that when the patient says he is worthless, unable to achieve, and morally despicable, he must be right. Freud believed the therapist should agree that the patient is uninteresting, unlovable, petty, self-centered, and dishonest.\nThe way a therapist handles your feelings of inadequacy is crucial to the cure, as your sense of worthlessness is a key to depression.\n Is human nature inherently defective? Are depressed patients actually facing the ultimate truth about themselves? What is the source of genuine self-esteem?\n You cannot earn worth through what you do Achievements can bring you satisfaction but not happiness.\nSelf-worth based on accomplishments is ‘pseudo-esteem.\"\nNor can love, approval, friendship, or a capacity for close, caring human relationships add one iota to your inherent worth. The great majority of depressed individuals are in fact very much loved, but it doesn’t help because self-love and self-esteem are missing. At the bottom line, only your own sense of self-worth determines how you feel\nTo reevaluate our own negative self-image. We raise the same question over and over again: “Are you really right when you insist that somewhere inside you are essentially a loser?”\nDuring periods of depression you lose some of your capacity for clear thinking; you have trouble putting things into proper perspective. Negative events grow in importance until they dominate your entire reality - and you can’t tell what is happening is distorted. It all seems very real to you. The illusion of hell you create is very convincing.\nOvercoming the sense of Worthlessness Pinpointing the nature or origin of your problem may give you insight, but usually fails to change the way you act. Ventilation of emotions and insight won’t help.\nSet some time aside to work at improving your self-image, this is the only way to experience the fastest and most enduring personal growth.\nSpecific methods for Boosting Self-esteem Talk back to your Internal Critic A sense of worthlessness is created by your internal self-critical dialogue. It is self-degrading statements like “I’m no damn good,” “I’m a shit,” “I’m inferior to other people” and so on. Those create and feed your feelings of despair and poor self-esteem. To overcome this bad mental habit, three steps are necessary:\n1. Train yourself to recognize and write down the self-critical thoughts as they go through your mind 2. Learn why these thoughts are distorted 3. Practice talking back to them to develop a more realistic self-evaluation system  what If you are a procrastinator, you probably aren’t aware of this. so you lie in bed waiting for inspiration to strike.\n    Target Symptoms Self-Activation techniques Purpose of the Method     1 You feel disorganized You have nothing to do. You get lonely and bored on weekends. Daily Activity Schedule Plan things one hour at a time and record the amount of mastery and pleasure. Any activity will make you feel better and will undercut your sense of inadequacy   2 You procrastinate because tasks seem too difficult and unrewarding The Antiprocrastination Sheet You put your negative predictions to the test   3 You feel overwhelmed by the urge to do nothing Daily Record of Dysfunctional thoughts You expose the illogical thoughts that paralyze you. Motivation follows action, not vice versa   4 You feel there’s no point in doing anything when you’re alone Pleasure-Predicting Sheet Schedule activities with the potential for personal growth or satisfaction, and predict how rewarding they will be. Compare the actual satisfaction experience when you are alone and when you are with others.   5 You give yourself excuses for avoiding things But-Rebuttal Combat ‘buts’ with realistic rebuttals   6 You have the idea that whatever you do isn’t worth much Self-Endorsement Write down the self-downing thoughts and talk back to them. Look for distorted thought patterns, such as ‘all-or-nothing thinking’ Make a list of things you accomplish each day.   7 You think about a task in a self-defeating manner TIC-TOC technique You substitute task-oriented cognitions for task-interfering cognitions   8 You feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of everything you have to do Little steps for little feet Break the task down into its tiny component parts, and do these one step at a time   9 You feel guilty, oppressed, obliged, and duty-bound Motivation without Coercion You list the advantages and disadvantages of any activity so you can begin to think in terms of what you want to do rather than what you must do   10 Someone else nags and harangues you. You feel pressured and resentful, so you refuse to do anything at all Disarming Technique You assertively agree with them and remind them that you are capable of doing your own thinking   11 You have difficulty modifying a habit such as smoking Visualize success Make a list of positive benefits of having changed the habit. You visualize these after inducing a state of deep relaxation   12 You feel unable to do anything on your own initiative Count what You count the things you do each day on your own initiative. This helps you overcome your bad habit of constantly dwelling on your inadequacies.   13 You feel inadequate and incompetent because you say “I can’t” Test your Can’ts You set up an experiment in which you challenge and disprove your negative predictions   14 You are afraid to fail, so you risk nothing “Can’t lose” system Write down any negative consequences of failure and develop a coping strategy ahead of time.    Verbal Judo: Learn to talk back when you’re under the fire of Criticism The cause of your sense of worthlessness is your ongoing self-criticism. This takes the form of an upsetting inter convesation in which you constantly persecute yourself in a harsh, unrealistic manner.\nYou may dread criticism because you have never learnt effective techniques for handling it. Many depressive episodes are set in motion by external criticism. Even psychiatrists, who are supposedly abuse-takers, can react adversely to criticism.\nWhy is criticism so hurtful to some people, while others can remain unperturbed in the face of the most abusive attack?\nOnly one person has the power to put you down and that’s you. When another person criticizes you, certain negative thoughts are triggered in your head. Your emotional reaction will be created by these thoughts and not by what the other person says. His panic was the result of his catastrophic interpretation: ‘This criticism shows how worthless I am.’\n","wordCount":"2588","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-01-02T07:40:51+07:00","dateModified":"2021-01-02T07:40:51+07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"baoqdau"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/learn/good/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"baoqdau","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.banhtrang.me accesskey=h title="baoqdau (Alt + H)"><img src=/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>baoqdau</a>

It doesn&rsquo;t occur to you to challenge the validity of the perceptions that create your feelings.</p><p>One usual side effect of emotional reasoning is procrastination. You avoid cleaning yp your desk because you tell yourself you can&rsquo;t do it. Six months later you finally give yourself a little push and do it. It turns out to be gratifying and not so tough at all.</p><h3 id=should-statements>Should statements<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#should-statements>#</a></h3><p>You motive yourself by saying &ldquo;I should do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;I must do that.&rdquo; These statements pressure and make you feel resentful. You end up feeling apathetic and unmotivated.</p><p>Should statements generate a lot of unnecessary emotional turmoil in your daily life. When the reality of your own behavior falls short of your standards, your shoulds and shouldn&rsquo;ts create self-loathing, shame, and guilt. When the all-too-human performance of other people fall short of your expectations, as will inevitably happen from time to time, you&rsquo;ll feel bitter and self-righteous.</p><h3 id=labeling-and-mislabeling>Labeling and Mislabeling<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#labeling-and-mislabeling>#</a></h3><p>Creating a completely negative self-image based on your errors. It is an extreme form of overgeneralization. The philosophy behind it is &ldquo;The measure of a man is the mistakes he makes.&rdquo;</p><p>When you describe your mistakes with sentences beginning with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>Labeling yourself is not only self-defeating, it is irrational. Your self cannot be equated with any one thing you do. Your life is a complex and ever-changing flow of thoughts, emotions, and actions. To put it another way, you are more like a river tha na statue. Stop trying to define yourself with negative labels - they are overly simplistic and wrong. This is nonsense, but such nonsense becomes painful when you label yourself out of a sense of your own inadequacies.</p><p>When you label other people, you will generate hostility.</p><p>Mislabeling involves describing an event with words that are inaccurate and emotionally heavily loaded.</p><h3 id=personalization>Personalization<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#personalization>#</a></h3><p>This distortion is the mother of guilt. You assume responsibility for a negative even when there is no basis for doing so. You arbitrarily conclude that what happened was your fault or reflects your inadequacy even when you were not responsible for it.</p><p>Personalization causes you to feel crippling guilt. You suffer from a sense of responsibility that forces you to carry the whole world on your shoulders. You have confused influence with control over others.</p><h1 id=start-by-building-self-esteem>Start by building Self-esteem<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#start-by-building-self-esteem>#</a></h1><p>When you are depressed, you believe that you are worthless. The worse the depression, the more you feel this way. Depressed patients see themselves as deficient in qualities they value most highly: intelligence, achievement, popularity, attractiveness, health, and strength.</p><p>Almost all negative emotional reactions inflict their damage only as a result of low self-esteem. If you are depressed or have ever been depressed, you may find it much harder to recognize the illogical thinking patterns which cause you to look down on yourself. You are probably convinced that you really are inferior or worthless.</p><p>When you are depressed you may not be alone in your conviction about your personal inadequacy. In many cases you will be so <em>persuasive</em> and <em>persistent</em> in your maladaptive belief that you are defective and no good, you may lead your friends, family, and even your therapist into accepting this idea of yourself. For many years psychiatrists have tended to &lsquo;buy into&rsquo; the negative self-evaluation system of depressed individuals without probing the validity of what the patients are saying about themselves. Freud argued that when the patient says he is worthless, unable to achieve, and morally despicable, he must be right. Freud believed the therapist should agree that the patient is uninteresting, unlovable, petty, self-centered, and dishonest.</p><p>The way a therapist handles your feelings of inadequacy is crucial to the cure, as your sense of worthlessness is a key to depression.</p><blockquote><p>Is human nature inherently defective? Are depressed patients actually facing the ultimate truth about themselves? <strong>What is the source of genuine self-esteem?</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id=you-cannot-earn-worth-through-what-you-do>You cannot earn worth through what you do<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#you-cannot-earn-worth-through-what-you-do>#</a></h2><p>Achievements can bring you satisfaction but not happiness.</p><p>Self-worth based on accomplishments is &lsquo;pseudo-esteem."</p><p>Nor can love, approval, friendship, or a capacity for close, caring human relationships add one iota to your inherent worth. The great majority of depressed individuals are in fact very much loved, but it doesn&rsquo;t help because self-love and self-esteem are missing. At the bottom line, only your own sense of self-worth determines how you feel</p><p>To reevaluate our own negative self-image. We raise the same question over and over again: &ldquo;Are you really right when you insist that somewhere inside you are essentially a loser?&rdquo;</p><p>During periods of depression you lose some of your capacity for clear thinking; you have trouble putting things into proper perspective. Negative events grow in importance until they dominate your entire reality - and you can&rsquo;t tell what is happening is distorted. It all seems very real to you. The illusion of hell you create is very convincing.</p><h2 id=overcoming-the-sense-of-worthlessness>Overcoming the sense of Worthlessness<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#overcoming-the-sense-of-worthlessness>#</a></h2><p>Pinpointing the nature or origin of your problem may give you insight, but usually fails to change the way you act. Ventilation of emotions and insight won&rsquo;t help.</p><p><strong>Set some time aside to work at improving your self-image</strong>, this is the only way to experience the fastest and most enduring personal growth.</p><h2 id=specific-methods-for-boosting-self-esteem>Specific methods for Boosting Self-esteem<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#specific-methods-for-boosting-self-esteem>#</a></h2><h3 id=talk-back-to-your-internal-critic>Talk back to your Internal Critic<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#talk-back-to-your-internal-critic>#</a></h3><p>A sense of worthlessness is created by your internal self-critical dialogue. It is self-degrading statements like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no damn good,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a shit,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inferior to other people&rdquo; and so on. Those create and feed your feelings of despair and poor self-esteem. To overcome this bad mental habit, three steps are necessary:</p><pre><code>1. Train yourself to recognize and write down the self-critical thoughts as they go through your mind
2. Learn why these thoughts are distorted
3. Practice talking back to them to develop a more realistic self-evaluation system

 has little to do with an exciting physical appearance of colorful personality: qualities that elicit short-term interst. clear vision, a quality of single-mindedness, and practical skills can be devastatingly charsmatic, provided it is matched with some success. it is an illusion in they eyes of those who see you as having what they lack. this is the guru effect. the aura you are after is not the fiery one of most charismatics. but one of incandescence, enlightenement. people are naturally drawn to those who emit happiness. maybe thye can catch it from you. let them see it in your unhurried manner, your gentle smile, your ease and comfort. keep your words vague, letting people imagine what they will. being aloof and istant only stimulates the effect. people will fight for the slightest sign of your interst. a guru is content and dtetached: a deadly charismatic combination you must learn to exploit the two great purveryors of emotion: drama and emotion. drama cuts out the useless and banal in life, focusing on moments of pity and terror. make your charitable actions dramatic, give your loing words religious import, bathe everything in rituals and myths going back to childhood. religion deals with matters of life and death. the only thing that cannot be faked is confidence. charisma depends of success the best way to maintain success, after initial charismatic rush, is to be practical and cautious.    the ugly  volatile. most often it stirs sentiments of love. but such feelings are hard to maintain. erotic fatigue: the moments after love in which you feel tired of it, resentful. at the first sign of weakness they turn on you. the love they showed before will be matched by their hatred now. the only defense is to master your charisma. too much charisma for too long creates fatigue, and adesire for calmness and order. a prophet may cquire power through his charismatic personality, he cannot survive wihtout the strength to back it up. the mass will be tired of him. this means being merciless with your enenies for as long as you retain power succeeding a Charismatic. the one who follows after a Charismatic is left with a mess, which the people do not see.  theatricality  surprisingly it is not the actor who screams the loudest or gestures the most wildy who works this magic best. but the actor who stays calm, radiating self-assuarance. the effect is ruined by trying too hard. it is essential to be self-aware, to have the ability to see yourself as others see you. De Gaulle understood that self-awareness was key to his vcharisma: he retained an Olympian composure that played beautifully agaistn the hysteria of his colleageues. when he spoke, noone bould their eyes off him. flamboyancy has nothing to do with charisma: once you know how to command attention, heigten the effect by appearing in ceremonial and reitual events that are full of exciting imagery  unihibitedness  most people are repressed and have little access to their unconscious: a problem that creats opportunities for the Charismatic. You will first have to show that you are less inhibited that your audeince: that you radiate a dangerous sexuality, have no fear of death, and delightfully spontaneous an extension of your being unihibited is a dreamlike quality in your works the repressed are rigid, their cousins is a fluidisty of body and spirit.  fervency  you need to believe in something, and to believe in it strongly enough for it to animate all yor gestures and make your eyes light up. a prerequisite for fiery belief is some great cause to rally around: a crusade. become the rallying point for people’s discontent. and show that your share non of the doubts that plague normal humans. people are more and more isolated, and we long for communcal experience. let your own fervent and contagious faith, in virtually anything, give them something to believe in.  vulnerability  displays a need for love and affection. we re open to their audience, and in fact feed off its energy. the audience in turn is electrified by the Charismatic. since charisma involves feelings akin to love, you must reveal your love for your followers. if the audience does not sense this quality in you they will turn away from you. you must never seem manipulative or needy. nothing is more seductive to people tan the feeling that they are desired.  adventurousness  unconventional. they have an air of adventure and risk that attracts the bored. be brazen and courageous in your actions. be seen taking risks for the good of others. Charismatics thrive in troubled waters. show heroism to give yourself a charism that will last you a lifetime. the slightest sign of cowardice or intimidity will ruin whatever charisma you had.  magnestism  the eyes are the most physical attribute to seduction. they reveal excitement, tension, detachment, without a word being spoken. indirect communication is critical in seduction, and also in charisma. the demeanor of charismatics maybe posed and calm, but their eyes are magnetic. they have a piercing gaze that disturbs their targets' emotions, exerting force without words or action. all of these skills are acquirable. the look does not necessarily have to be aggressive. it can also show contenetment. your eyes can emanate charisma, but they can also give you away as a faker.  the savior  Lenin alone was followed unhesistatingly as the only indisputable leader. he was a man of iron will and inmitable energy who combines fanatical faith the movement, the cause, with no less faith in himself. at a time when other politicians were scrambling deperately to adapt to the national crisis, Lenin was rock stable  the deliverer  the deliverer provides an opportunity for the release of bottled-up emotions from other people: of the hostility masked by forced politeness and smiles. dilvererers have to be one of the suffering crowd, only more so. their pain must be exemplary. the dliverer must be a living example of personal redemption.   charismatic types  joan of arc: peasant french girl who had a vision so vivid, so detailled that she could convice the king to go to war with England. they lost but see, she was a good hustler. rasputin: the authentic animal  charisma what to learn form these people  describe these things in great detail, with an air of authority, and suddenly you stand out. if your prophecy is what people want to hear, they are lilely to fall under your spell. you will create a self-fulfilling prophecy: people’s belief in you will translate into actions that help realize your visions. people are more complicated than the masks they wear in society. the man who seems so noble and gentle is probably disguising a dark side, which will often come out in strange ways. on the ohter hand, we are drawn to people who seem more comforably human, who do not bother to disguise their contradictions. a man so authentically himself, so devoid of self-conscriousness or hypocrisy, is immensely appealing. his wickedness and saintliness were so extreme that it made him seem larger than life. the essence of charisma is an overpwering emotion that comunicates itself in your gestures, in your tone of bvoice, insubtle signs that are the more powerful for being unspoken. express what others are afraid to say and they will see great power in you. say what they want to say but cannot. never be afraid of goin too far.  the olympian actor  when using it is best to radiate calmness and control. to use dramatic effects sparingly double the effectiveness of the brief moents when you raise your voice or let loose a biting joke. all this must be carefully orchestrated. the  repressed  most of us are a mix of the devil and the saint, the noble and the ignoble. and we spend our lives trying to repress the dark side. few of us can give free rein to both sides. but we can create charisma to a smaller degree by riding ourselves of self-consciousness. anything extraordinary will create charisma. a crowd or group of any sort has a unique energy. just below the surface is desire, a constant sexual excutement has to be repressed because it is socially unacceptable. your uninhibitedness will invite other people to open up, sparking a chain reaction: their excitement will in turn animate you still more.  THE STAR  mythic star  People are divided by all kinds of consciously recognized categories: race, gender, class, religion, politics. It is impossible, then, to gain power on a grand scale, or to win an election, by drawing on conscious awareness; an appeal to any one group will only alienate another. Unconsciously, however, there is much we share. All of us are mortal, all of us know fear, all of us have been stamped with the imprint of parent figures; and nothing cojues up this shared experience more than myth.\n  your words and actions should invite interpretation beyond their surface appearance. you should seem to be dealing with matters of life and death, love and hate, authority and chaos.  keys to the character  form of persuasion that seeks to bypass consciousness, stirring the unconscious mind instead. we are so surrounded by stimuli that compete for our attention, bombarding us with obvious messages. we have grown increasingly cynical. learn the art of insinuation: reaching the unconscious. d  ","wordCount":"1558","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-12-15T16:26:23-05:00","dateModified":"2020-12-15T16:26:23-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"baoqdau"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/learn/seduction/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"baoqdau","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.banhtrang.me accesskey=h title="baoqdau (Alt + H)"><img src=/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>baoqdau</a>

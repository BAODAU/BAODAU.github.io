<h2 id="be-precise-in-specifying-my-problem">be precise in specifying my problem</h2>

<p>very poor work habits (react randomly to the stuff that comes at me, cant bring my self to do the statuff that i need to do but dont like to do)</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t pay any attention to my belongings</p>

<p>i dont pay enough attention at school</p>

<p>my place is really messy</p>

<p>there are days where I don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t do anything</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like college</p>

<p>I am unconfident around girls? why do i do that bruh?</p>

<p>i jerk off way too much damn</p>

<p>i often act on my impulse</p>

<p>i am very bad at money. i go into debt over consumer purchases.</p>

<p>i cannot open up</p>

<p>i value how people perceive me way too much</p>

<p>unable to communicate what i want and feel</p>

<p>always misplace things?</p>

<p>this is very bad: i miss my bus twice. very disorganized.</p>

<p>i let my ego in between achieving what i want to and have to do</p>

<h2 id="questions">questions</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>get at the root causes.</p></li>

<li><p>now here is the question. what caused all of my problems?
people are often upset when their mistakes are pointed out to them. most people are reluctant to point out mistakes in others. what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don&rsquo;t is a willingness to look at themeslves and others objectively.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>we focus on short term gratification rather than long term satisfaction. if i can somehow make the connection between the pain of the process and the results that come along with it.</p>

<p><em><em>to be successful, i have to look at my own behavior and the behavior of others as possible causes of problems</em></em></p>

<h2 id="questions-1">questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>am i willing to touch the nerve?</li>
<li>willing to get at root causes?</li>
<li>seeing the patterns and syntehsizing them into diagnoses of root causes?</li>
<li>confidence?</li>
<li>why confident?</li>
</ul>

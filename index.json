[{"content":"Understand you Moods: You feel the Way you think Every bad feelings you have is the result of your distorted negative thinking. Intense negative thinking always accompanies a depressive episode, or any painful emotion for that matter.\n Every time I become depressed, I feel as if I have been hit with a sudden cosmic jolt, and begin to see things differently. The change can come within less than an hour. My thoughts become negative and pessimistic. As I look into the past, I become convinced that everything that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done is worthless. Any happy period seems like an illusion. I become convinced that the real me is worthless and inadequate. I can\u0026rsquo;t move forward with my work because I become frozen with doubt. But I can\u0026rsquo;t stand still because the misery is unbearable.\n The negative thoughts that flood your mind are the actual cause of your self-defeating emotions. These thoughts are what keep you lethargic and make you feel inadequate. Your negative thoughts are the most frequently overlooked symptoms of your depression. Every time you feel depressed about something, try to identify a corresponding negative thought you had just prior to and during the depression. These thoughts have actually created your bad mood, by learning to restructure them, you can change your mood.\nIf your understanding of what is happening is accurate. If your perception is twisted and distorted in some way, your emotional response will be abnormal.\nCognitive Distortions Overview of Cognitive Distortions\n         All-or-nothing thinking You see things in black-and-white. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.   Overgeneralization You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.   Mental filter You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively   Disqualifying the positive You reject positive experiences by insisting they \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t count.\u0026rdquo;   Jumping to conclusions You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion: a. Someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don\u0026rsquo;t bother to check this out. b. You anticipate that things turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an already-established fact.   Magnification or Minimization You exaggerate the importance of things (your failures) or shrink things (your achievements) until they appear tiny.   Emotional Reasoning You assume negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are   Should Statements You try to motivate yourself with should statements. As if you have to be whipped and punished before you could do anything. The emotional consequence is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others, you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.   Labeling and Mislabeling An extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a loser.\u0026rdquo; When someone else\u0026rsquo;s behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him. Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.   Personalization You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which you were not primarily responsible for.    All-or-nothing thinking Tendency to evaluate your personal qualities in extreme, black-or-white categories. It causes you to fear any mistake or imperfections because you will then see yourself as a complete loser, and you will feel inadequate and worthless.\nThis way of evaluating things in unrealistic because life is rarely one way or the other. No one is absolutely brilliant or totally stupid. Similarly, no one is either completely attractive or totally ugly. This type of perceptual error is \u0026lsquo;dichotomous thinking.\u0026rsquo; You see everything as black or white - shades of grey do not exist.\nOvergeneralization The pain of rejection is generated almost entirely from overgeneralization.\nMental filter You pick out a negative detail in any situation and dwell on it exclusively, thus perceiving that the whole situation is negative. When you are depressed, you wear a pair of eyeglasses with special lenses that filter out anything positive. All that you allow to enter your conscious mind is negative.\nDisqualifying the positive Transform neutral or even positive experiences into negative ones. An everyday example of this would be the way most of us have been conditioned to respond to compliments.\nThe hypothesis that dominates your depressive thinking is some version of \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m second rate\u0026rdquo; Whenever you have a negative experience, you dwell on it and conclude, \u0026ldquo;That proves what I\u0026rsquo;ve known all along\u0026rdquo; When you have a positive experience, you tell yourself, \u0026ldquo;That wa a fluke. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile this type of cognitive distortion is commonplace, it can also form the basis for some of the most extreme forms of depression.\nJumping to conclusions Mind reading Make the assumption that other people look down on you and you\u0026rsquo;re so convinced about this that you don\u0026rsquo;t even bother to check it out. You may respond to these imagined negative reactions by withdrawal or counterattack. This self-defeating behavior pattern may act as a self-fulfilling prophecy and set up a negative interaction.\nFortune teller error You imagine that something bad is about to happen, and you take this prediction as a fact even though it is unrealistic.\nMagnification and Minimization You look at things out of proportion. You diminish your strengths and magnify your imperfections or problems.\nEmotional Reasoning This kind of reasoning is misleading because your feelings reflect your thoughts and beliefs.\n        I feel overwhelmed and hopeless. Therefore my problems must be impossible to solve.   I feel inadequate. Therefore, I must be a worthless person.   I\u0026rsquo;m not in the mood to do anything. Therefore I might as well just lie in bed.   I\u0026rsquo;m mad at you. This proves that you\u0026rsquo;ve been acting rotten and trying to take advantage of me.   I feel like a dud, therefore I am a dud    Emotional reasoning plays a role in nearly all your depressions. Because things feel negative to you, you assume they truly are. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t occur to you to challenge the validity of the perceptions that create your feelings.\nOne usual side effect of emotional reasoning is procrastination. You avoid cleaning yp your desk because you tell yourself you can\u0026rsquo;t do it. Six months later you finally give yourself a little push and do it. It turns out to be gratifying and not so tough at all.\nShould statements You motive yourself by saying \u0026ldquo;I should do this\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I must do that.\u0026rdquo; These statements pressure and make you feel resentful. You end up feeling apathetic and unmotivated.\nShould statements generate a lot of unnecessary emotional turmoil in your daily life. When the reality of your own behavior falls short of your standards, your shoulds and shouldn\u0026rsquo;ts create self-loathing, shame, and guilt. When the all-too-human performance of other people fall short of your expectations, as will inevitably happen from time to time, you\u0026rsquo;ll feel bitter and self-righteous.\nLabeling and Mislabeling Creating a completely negative self-image based on your errors. It is an extreme form of overgeneralization. The philosophy behind it is \u0026ldquo;The measure of a man is the mistakes he makes.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen you describe your mistakes with sentences beginning with \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nLabeling yourself is not only self-defeating, it is irrational. Your self cannot be equated with any one thing you do. Your life is a complex and ever-changing flow of thoughts, emotions, and actions. To put it another way, you are more like a river tha na statue. Stop trying to define yourself with negative labels - they are overly simplistic and wrong. This is nonsense, but such nonsense becomes painful when you label yourself out of a sense of your own inadequacies.\nWhen you label other people, you will generate hostility.\nMislabeling involves describing an event with words that are inaccurate and emotionally heavily loaded.\nPersonalization This distortion is the mother of guilt. You assume responsibility for a negative even when there is no basis for doing so. You arbitrarily conclude that what happened was your fault or reflects your inadequacy even when you were not responsible for it.\nPersonalization causes you to feel crippling guilt. You suffer from a sense of responsibility that forces you to carry the whole world on your shoulders. You have confused influence with control over others.\nStart by building Self-esteem When you are depressed, you believe that you are worthless. The worse the depression, the more you feel this way. Depressed patients see themselves as deficient in qualities they value most highly: intelligence, achievement, popularity, attractiveness, health, and strength.\nAlmost all negative emotional reactions inflict their damage only as a result of low self-esteem. If you are depressed or have ever been depressed, you may find it much harder to recognize the illogical thinking patterns which cause you to look down on yourself. You are probably convinced that you really are inferior or worthless.\nWhen you are depressed you may not be alone in your conviction about your personal inadequacy. In many cases you will be so persuasive and persistent in your maladaptive belief that you are defective and no good, you may lead your friends, family, and even your therapist into accepting this idea of yourself. For many years psychiatrists have tended to \u0026lsquo;buy into\u0026rsquo; the negative self-evaluation system of depressed individuals without probing the validity of what the patients are saying about themselves. Freud argued that when the patient says he is worthless, unable to achieve, and morally despicable, he must be right. Freud believed the therapist should agree that the patient is uninteresting, unlovable, petty, self-centered, and dishonest.\nThe way a therapist handles your feelings of inadequacy is crucial to the cure, as your sense of worthlessness is a key to depression.\n Is human nature inherently defective? Are depressed patients actually facing the ultimate truth about themselves? What is the source of genuine self-esteem?\n You cannot earn worth through what you do Achievements can bring you satisfaction but not happiness.\nSelf-worth based on accomplishments is \u0026lsquo;pseudo-esteem.\u0026quot;\nNor can love, approval, friendship, or a capacity for close, caring human relationships add one iota to your inherent worth. The great majority of depressed individuals are in fact very much loved, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help because self-love and self-esteem are missing. At the bottom line, only your own sense of self-worth determines how you feel\nTo reevaluate our own negative self-image. We raise the same question over and over again: \u0026ldquo;Are you really right when you insist that somewhere inside you are essentially a loser?\u0026rdquo;\nDuring periods of depression you lose some of your capacity for clear thinking; you have trouble putting things into proper perspective. Negative events grow in importance until they dominate your entire reality - and you can\u0026rsquo;t tell what is happening is distorted. It all seems very real to you. The illusion of hell you create is very convincing.\nOvercoming the sense of Worthlessness Pinpointing the nature or origin of your problem may give you insight, but usually fails to change the way you act. Ventilation of emotions and insight won\u0026rsquo;t help.\nSet some time aside to work at improving your self-image, this is the only way to experience the fastest and most enduring personal growth.\nSpecific methods for Boosting Self-esteem Talk back to your Internal Critic A sense of worthlessness is created by your internal self-critical dialogue. It is self-degrading statements like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m no damn good,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a shit,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m inferior to other people\u0026rdquo; and so on. Those create and feed your feelings of despair and poor self-esteem. To overcome this bad mental habit, three steps are necessary:\n1. Train yourself to recognize and write down the self-critical thoughts as they go through your mind 2. Learn why these thoughts are distorted 3. Practice talking back to them to develop a more realistic self-evaluation system  what If you are a procrastinator, you probably aren\u0026rsquo;t aware of this. so you lie in bed waiting for inspiration to strike.\n    Target Symptoms Self-Activation techniques Purpose of the Method     1 You feel disorganized You have nothing to do. You get lonely and bored on weekends. Daily Activity Schedule Plan things one hour at a time and record the amount of mastery and pleasure. Any activity will make you feel better and will undercut your sense of inadequacy   2 You procrastinate because tasks seem too difficult and unrewarding The Antiprocrastination Sheet You put your negative predictions to the test   3 You feel overwhelmed by the urge to do nothing Daily Record of Dysfunctional thoughts You expose the illogical thoughts that paralyze you. Motivation follows action, not vice versa   4 You feel there\u0026rsquo;s no point in doing anything when you\u0026rsquo;re alone Pleasure-Predicting Sheet Schedule activities with the potential for personal growth or satisfaction, and predict how rewarding they will be. Compare the actual satisfaction experience when you are alone and when you are with others.   5 You give yourself excuses for avoiding things But-Rebuttal Combat \u0026lsquo;buts\u0026rsquo; with realistic rebuttals   6 You have the idea that whatever you do isn\u0026rsquo;t worth much Self-Endorsement Write down the self-downing thoughts and talk back to them. Look for distorted thought patterns, such as \u0026lsquo;all-or-nothing thinking\u0026rsquo; Make a list of things you accomplish each day.   7 You think about a task in a self-defeating manner TIC-TOC technique You substitute task-oriented cognitions for task-interfering cognitions   8 You feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of everything you have to do Little steps for little feet Break the task down into its tiny component parts, and do these one step at a time   9 You feel guilty, oppressed, obliged, and duty-bound Motivation without Coercion You list the advantages and disadvantages of any activity so you can begin to think in terms of what you want to do rather than what you must do   10 Someone else nags and harangues you. You feel pressured and resentful, so you refuse to do anything at all Disarming Technique You assertively agree with them and remind them that you are capable of doing your own thinking   11 You have difficulty modifying a habit such as smoking Visualize success Make a list of positive benefits of having changed the habit. You visualize these after inducing a state of deep relaxation   12 You feel unable to do anything on your own initiative Count what You count the things you do each day on your own initiative. This helps you overcome your bad habit of constantly dwelling on your inadequacies.   13 You feel inadequate and incompetent because you say \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; Test your Can\u0026rsquo;ts You set up an experiment in which you challenge and disprove your negative predictions   14 You are afraid to fail, so you risk nothing \u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t lose\u0026rdquo; system Write down any negative consequences of failure and develop a coping strategy ahead of time.    Verbal Judo: Learn to talk back when you\u0026rsquo;re under the fire of Criticism The cause of your sense of worthlessness is your ongoing self-criticism. This takes the form of an upsetting inter convesation in which you constantly persecute yourself in a harsh, unrealistic manner.\nYou may dread criticism because you have never learnt effective techniques for handling it. Many depressive episodes are set in motion by external criticism. Even psychiatrists, who are supposedly abuse-takers, can react adversely to criticism.\nWhy is criticism so hurtful to some people, while others can remain unperturbed in the face of the most abusive attack?\nOnly one person has the power to put you down and that\u0026rsquo;s you. When another person criticizes you, certain negative thoughts are triggered in your head. Your emotional reaction will be created by these thoughts and not by what the other person says. His panic was the result of his catastrophic interpretation: \u0026lsquo;This criticism shows how worthless I am.\u0026rsquo;\nI should set some time aside each day to work at improving my self-image because only in this way can I experience the fastest and most enduring personal growth.\nMethods for boosting self-esteem Talk back to that internal Critic A sense of worthlessness is create by your internal self-critical dialogue. In order to overcome this bad mental habit, three steps are necessary:\n Train yourself to recognize and write down the self-critical thoughts as they go through your mind. Learn why these thoughts are distorted Practice talking back to them so as to develop a more realistic self-evaluation system.

Only when it is too late that we discover that their confidence is irrational and their ideas ill-conceived. What inevitably happens in these situations is that we are caught off guard, not expecting such behavior. Often these types will hit us with elaborate cover stories to justify their actions, or blame handy scapegoat.\nWhat if we could look within and see the source of our more troubling emotions and why they drive our behavior, often against our own wishes? What if we could understand why we are so compelled to desire what other people have, or to identify so strongly with a group\nThe survival of our earliest ancestors depended on their ability to communicate with one another well before the invention of language.\nBeing around people stirs up our anxieties and insecurities as to how others perceive us. Once we feel such emotions, it becomes very hard to observe people as we are drawing into our own feelings, evaluating what people say and do in personal terms: do they like me or dislike me?\nYou will think in terms of opposites - when people display some trait, such as confidence or hypermasculinity, they are most often concealing the contrary reality. People are continually playing to the public, making a show of being progressive and saintly only to disguise their shadow. If people take an action that seems out of character: what often appears out of character is actually more of their true character. If people are essentially lazy or foolish, they leave clues to this in the smallest of details that you can pick up well before their behavior harms you. The ability to gauge people\u0026rsquo;s true worth, their degree of loyalty and conscientiousness, is one of the most important skills you can possess.\nMaster your Emotional Self You like to imagine yourself in control of your fate, consciously planning the course of your life as best you can. But you are unaware of how deeply you emotions dominate you. They make you veer toward ideas that soothe your ego. They make you look for evidence that confirms what you already want to believe. They make you see what you want to see, and this disconnect from reality is the source of the bad decisions and negative patterns that haunt your life. Rationality is the ability to counteract these emotional effects. It does not come naturally; it is a power we must cultivate, but in doing so we realize our greatest potential.\nRationality is not a power you are born with but one you acquire through training and practice. You are infected by all of the drama that others churn up; you are reacting to what people give you, experiencing waves of excitement, insecurity, and anxiety that make it hard to . Your attention is pulled this way and that, and without the rational standard to guide your decisions, you never quite reach the goals that you set. At any moment this can change with a simple decision. Rationality is then what you will value the most and that which will serve as your guide.\nYour first task is to look at emotions that are infecting your ideas and decisions. You will begin to think for yourself instead of reacting to what others give you. Emotions tend to narrow the mind, making us focus on one or two ideas that satisfy our immediate desire for power or attention, ideas that backfire.\nQuestion yourself  Why this anger or resentment? Where does this incessant need for attention come from?  Transform Self-love into Empathy The Law of Narcissism We possess the tool for attaining social power: empathy. When cultivated and properly used, it can allow us to see into the moods and minds of others, giving us the power to anticipate people\u0026rsquo;s actions and lower their resistance. This instrument is blunted by our habitual self-absorption. We are all narcissists. Our mission in life is to come to terms with this self-love and learn how to turn our sensitivity outward.\nThe Narcissistic Spectrum we humans feel a never-ending need for attention. We are social animals to the core. Our survival and happiness depend on the bonds we form with others. If people do not pay attention to us, we cannot connect to them on any level. As those who have gone through long periods of isolation, without eye contact we begin to doubt our existence and to descend into a deep depression. Through the quality of attention we receive from others, we feel recognized and appreciated for who we are. Our sense of self-worth depends on this. People will do almost anything to get attention, including committing a crime or attempting suicide.\nWe face an inevitable problem: there is only so much of it to go around. We have to compete for attention. People can lbe indifferent to our fate, as they must deal with their own problems. There are some who are downright hostile and disrespectful to us. How do we handle those moments when we feel psychologically alone, or even abandoned? We can double our efforts to get attention and notice, but this can exhaust our energy and it can often have the opposite effect: people who try too hard seem desperate and repulse the attention they want.\nFacing this dilemma, most of us come up with a solution: we create a self, an image of ourselves that comforts us and makes us feel validated from within. This self is composed of our tastes, our opinions, how we look at the world, what we value. In building this self-image, we tend to accentuate our positive qualities and explain away our flaws. If our self-image is too divorced from reality, other people will make us aware of the discrepancy, and we will doubt ourselves. If it is done properly, in the end we have a self that we can love and cherish. Our energy turns inward. We become the center of our attention. When we experience those moments when we are alone and not appreciated, we can retreat to this self and soothe ourselves. This self-image operates as a thermostat, helping us to regulate our doubts and insecurities. We ar eno longer dependent on others for attention and recognition. We have self-esteem.\nIn childhood, if narcissists are extroverts they can thrive. They become masters at attracting attention. But underneath the surface, they are addicted to the hits of attention. If they are introverts, they will retreat to a fantasy life, imagining a self that is quite superior to others. They will not get validation of this self-image from others because it is so unrealistic, they have moments of great doubt and even self-loathing. Lacking a coherent core, they could imagine themselves to be anyone. The nightmares for deep narcissists arrives in their twenties and thirties. They have failed to develop that inner thermostat, a cohesive sense of self to love and depend upon. The extroverts must attract attention to feel alive and appreciated. They become more dramatic, more exhibitionistic and grandiose. This can become tiresome and even pathetic. They have to change friends and scenes so that they can have a fresh audience. Introverts fall deeper into a fantasy self. Being socially awkward yet radiating superiority, they tend to alienate people, increasing their dangerous isolation. In both cases, addiction can become a necessary crutch to soothe them in the inevitable moments of doubt and depression.\nYou can recognize deep narcissists by the following behavior patterns: If they are ever insulted or challenged they have no defense, nothing internal to soothe them or validate their worth. They generally react with great rage, thirsting for vengeance, full of a sense of righteousness. This is the only way they know how to assuage their insecurities. They will position themselves as the wounded victim, confusing others and even drawing sympathy. They are prickly and oversensitive. Almost everything ist taken personally. They can become quite paranoid and have enemies in all directions to point to. You can see an impatient or distant look on their face whenever you talk about something that does not directly involve them in some way. They turn the conversation back to themselves, with some story or anecdote to distract from the insecurity behind it. They can be prone to vicious bouts of envy if they see others getting the attention the feel they deserve. They frequently display extreme self-confidence. This always helps to gain attention, and it neatly covers up their gaping inner emptiness and their fragmented sense of self. But beware if this confidence is ever truly put to the test.\nWhen it comes to other people in their lives, deep narcissists have an unusual relationship that is hard for us to understand. They tend to see others as extensions of themselves, what is known as self-objects. People exist as instruments for attention and validation. Their desire is to control them like they control their own arm or leg. In a relationship, they will slowly make the partner cut off contact with friends: there must be no competition for attention.\nSome highly talented deep narcissists manage to find some redemption through their work, channeling their energies and getting the attention they crave through their accomplishments, although they tend to remain quite erratic and volatile. Lacking the self-esteem thermostat, they are prone to worrying about what others think of them. This makes it hard to focus attention outward for long periods of time, and to deal with the impatience and anxiety that comes with work. There types tend to change jobs and careers quite frequently. This becomes the nail in their coffin: unable to attract genuine recognition through their accomplishments, they are forever thrown back on the need to artificially stimulate attention.\nDeep narcissists can be annoying and frustrating to deal with; they can also become quite harmful if we get too close to them. They entangle us in their never-ending dramas and make us feel guilty if we are not continually paying them attention. Relationships with them are most unsatisfying, and having one as a partner or spouse can be deadly. The best solution in such cases is to get out of their way, once we identify them as a deep narcissist.\nThere is one variety of this type that is more dangerous and toxic because of the levels of power they can attain: the narcissistic leader. Full of narcissistic self-confidence, they attract attention and followers. they say and do things that other people don\u0026rsquo;t dare say or do, which seems admirable and authentic. They might have a vision for some innovative product, they can find others to help them realize their vision. **They are experts at using people. **\nIf they have success, a terrible momentum is set in place - more people are attracted to their leadership, which only inflates their grandiose tendencies. They are hypersensitive. They also like to stir up constant drama as a means to justify their power: they are the only ones who can solve the problems they create. This also gives them more opportunities to be the center of attention. The workplace is never stable under their direction. Sometimes they can become entrepreneurs because of their charisma and ability to attract followers. They can have creative flair as well. But for many of these leader types, eventually their own inner instability and chaos will come to be mirrored in the company or group they lead. They have to control everything and everyone, their self-objects. They will proclaim this as a virtue - as being authentic and spontaneous, when in reality they lack the ability to focus and create something solid. They tend to burn and destroy whatever they create.\nScale of Narcissism let us imagine Narcissism as a way of gauging the level of our self absorption as if it existed on a measurable scale from high to low. At a certain depth, let us say below the halfway mark on the scale, people enter the realm of deep narcissism. Once they reach this depth, it is very difficult for us to raise ourselves back up because we lack self-esteem device. If they engage with others, some comment or action will trigger their insecurities and they will go plummeting down. But they tend to sink deeper into themselves over time. Other people are instruments. Reality is a reflection of their needs. Constant attention is their only way of survival.\nAbove that halfway mark is what we shall call the functional narcissist, where most of us reside. We also are self-absorbed, but what prevents us from falling deep into ourselves is a coherent sense of self that we can rely upon and love. This creates some inner resiliency. We may have deeper narcissistic moments fluctuating below the mark, particularly when depressed or challenged in life, but inevitably we elevate ourselves. Not feeling continually insecure or wounded, not always needing to fish for attention, functional narcissists can turn their attention outward, into their work and into building relationships with people. It is ironic that the word narcissism has come to mean self-love, when it is in fact the case that worst narcissists have no cohesive self to love, when it is in fact the case that the worst narcissists have no cohesive self-love, which is the source of their problem.\nWhat to do with our own narcissism Understanding We must understand the phenomenon of the deep narcissist. Although they are in the minority, some of them can inflict an unusual amount of harm in the world. We must be able to distinguish the toxic types that stir up drama and try to turn us into objects they can use for their purposes. They can draw us in with their unusual energy, but if we become enmeshed, it can be a nightmare to disengage. They are masters at turning the tables and making others feel guilty. Narcissistic leaders are the most dangerous, and we must resist their pull.\nOur nature We must be honest about our own nature and not deny it. We are all narcissists. In a conversation we are all champing at the bit to talk, to tell our story, to give our opinion. We like people who share our ideas: they reflect back to us our good taste. If we happen to be assertive, we see assertiveness as a positive quality because it is ours. Whereas timid people will rate it as obnoxious and value introspective qualities. We are all prone to flattery because of our self-love Moralizers who try to separate themselves and denounce the narcissists in the world are the biggest narcissists: they love the sound of their voice as they point fingers and preach. We are all on the spectrum of self-absorption. Creating a self that we can love is a healthy development, and there should be no stigma attached to it. Without self-esteem from within, we would fall into deep narcissism. But to move beyond functional narcissism, which should be our goal, we must first be honest with ourselves. Trying to deny our self-absorbed nature, trying to pretend we are somehow more altruistic makes it impossible for us to transform ourselves.\nHealthy narcissist They have a stronger, more resilient sense of self. They tend to hover closer to the top of the scale. They recover more quickly from wounds or insults. They do not need as much validation from others. They realize at some point in life that they have limits and flaws. They can laugh at these flaws and not take slights so personally. By embracing the full pictures of themselves, their self-love is more real and complete. From this stronger inner position, they can turn their attention outward more often and more easily. This attention goes in one of two directions: creative work or people.\nBecause their outward focus on the work is more intense, they tend to be successful in their ventures, which gives them the necessary attention and validation. They can have moments of doubt and insecurity, and artists can be brittle, but work stands as a continual release from too much much self-absorption.\nThe other direction is toward people, developing empathic powers. Imagine empathy as the realm lying at the very top of the scale beyond: complete absorption in others. By our very nature, we humans have tremendous abilities to understand people from the inside out. In our earliest years, we felt completely bonded with our mother, we could sense her every mood and read her every emotion in a preverbal way. Unlike any other animal or primate, we also had the ability to extend this beyond the mother to other caregivers and people in our vicinity.\nThe need to develop this empathy is greater than ever. Young people are more self-absorbed since the late 70s. If your attention is continually interrupted by the need to look at phones, you can never understand the feelings or perspectives of other people. You are drawn back to yourself, never really engage. **Even in a crowd, you remain essentially alone. ** People come to serve a function - not to bond with but to placate your insecurities.\nOur brains were built for continual social interaction; the complexity of this interaction is the main factors that increased our intelligence as a species. At a certain point, involving ourselves with others has a net negative effect on the brain itself and atrophies our social muscle.\nYou must try to fight against these developments and create empathic energy. As you tune up your empathy , you get constant positive feedback. People want to be around you more. You develop your empathic muscle; your work improves; without trying, you gain the attention that all humans thrive on. Empathy creates positive, upward momentum.\nEmpathic skillset Empathic attitude The greatest danger you face is your general assumption that you really understand people and that you can quickly judge and categorize them. The people around you present a mask that suits their purposes. You mistake the mask for reality. Let go of your tendency to make snap judgments. Open your mind to seeing people in a new light. Do not assume that you are similar or that they share your values. Each person you meet is like an undiscovered country, with a very particular psychological chemistry that you will carefully explore. This flexible is similar to creative energy. Developing your empathy will also improve your creative powers.\nThe best place to begin this transformation is in your numerous daily conversations. Desire instead to hear the other person\u0026rsquo;s point of view. You have tremendous curiosity in this direction. Cut off your incessant interior monologue as best you can. Give full attention to the other. What matters is the quality of your listening, so you can mirror back to the other person things they said or things that were left unsaid but that you sensed. As part of this attitude, you are giving people the same level of indulgence that you give yourself. When we make a mistake, we attribute it to circumstances that pushed us into doing it. When others make a mistake, we tend to see it as a character flaw.\nAdopting this attitude depends on the quality of your self-love. If you feel terribly superior to others, or gripped by insecurities, you moments of empathy and absorption in people will be shallow. What you need is a complete acceptance of your character, including your flaws, which you can see, appreciate, and love. You are not perfect, you are not an angel. You have the same nature as others. From a position of genuine inner strength and resilience, you can more easily direct your attention outward.\nVisceral empathy Empathy is an instrument of emotional attunement. People are continually affecting our moods. What you are doing is turning this physiological response into knowledge. When they talk, they have a feeling tone that is either in sync or not in sync with what they are saying. This tone can be one of confidence, insecurity, defensiveness, arrogance, frustration, elation. You must try to detect this before even paying attention to what they are saying. This will register to you viscerally, in your own physical response to them.\nA key element you are trying to figure out is people\u0026rsquo;s intentions. There is always an emotion behind any intention. People do shit to gain things. When we see someone smiling and in a good mood, it tends to have a contagious effect on us. Mirroring people on any level will draw out an empathic response from them. This can be physical and is known as the chameleon effect. People who are connected physically and emotionally will mimic each other\u0026rsquo;s gestures and posture. This is why people who score high on empathy are generally excellent mimics.\nEven better, you can enter the spirit of the other person. You absorb their mood deeply and reflect it back to them. You create a feeling of rapport. People crave this emotional rapport in their daily lives. It has a hypnotic effect and appeals to people\u0026rsquo;s narcissism as you become their mirror. In practicing this type of empathy, you must maintain a degree of distance.\nAnalytic empathy The reason you are able to understand your friends or partner is that you have a lot of info about their tastes, values, and family background. We\u0026rsquo;ve had the experience of thinking we know someone but over time having to adjust our original impression once we get more info.\nThere are people who we can\u0026rsquo;t put ourselves in their shoes. Naturally we resort to judging and putting them into categories. There are people out there who are not worth the effort - supreme fools or true psychopaths. But for most others who seem hard to figure out, we should see it as an excellent challenge and a way to improve our skills.\n I don\u0026rsquo;t like that man. I must get to know him better.\n  Abraham Lincoln\n Analytic empathy comes mostly through conversation and gathering information that will allow you to get inside the spirit of others. You want to read on people\u0026rsquo;s values, which are mostly established in their earliest years. People develop concepts of what they consider strong, sensitive, generous, and weak often based on their parents and their relationship to them. By not understanding people\u0026rsquo;s values, you will misread their reactions and create unnecessary conflicts.\nYour goal is to gather as much as you can about the early years of the people you are studying and their relationship to their parents and siblings. Keep in mind that their current relationship to family will also speak volumes about the past. **Try to get a read on their reactions to authority figures. **This will help you see to what extent they have a rebellious or submissive streak. In general people love to talk about themselves and their past.\nIf people seem reluctant to talk, try asking open-ended questions, or begin with a sincere admission of your own establish trust. In general people love to talk about themselves and their past, and it is usually quite easy to get them to open up. If they come from another culture, it is important to understand this culture from within their experience. Your goal is general is to find out what makes them unique.\nProcess You need feedback. You sense a greater rapport and how certain techniques have worked for you. The more people you interact with in the flesh, the better you will get at this. The greater the variety of people you meet, the more versatile your skill will become. In an encounter, keep your attention active to see how the other person changes over the course of a conversation and the effect you are having on them. Be alive to the moment. Try to see people as they interact with others besides you: people are often very different depending on the person they are involved with.\nTry to not focus on categories but on the feeling tone and mood that people evoke in you, which is continually shifting. You will notice more. Continually mix the visceral with the analytic.\nSeeing improvement in your skill level will excite you greatly and motivate you to go deeper.\n The deepest principle of Human Nature is the craving to be appreciated.\n  William James\n Four examples of Narcissistic Types When you listen to others, do it with such intensity and interest, that your eyes bore into your opponent. People like Stalin seemed to pick up your deepest thoughts and doubts. But his greatest trait was to make you feel important and part of the inner circle of revolutionaries. You have to create a sense that there is now a bond that link you and your opponent together forever.\nHow can someone connect with others when they are so clearly self-obsessed? These types have more ambition and energy than the average deep narcissist. They also tend to have even greater insecurities. The only way they can mollify these insecurities and satisfy their ambition is by gaining from others more than the usual share of attention and validation, which can only come through\n","permalink":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/learn/laws-of-human-nature/","summary":"We have to deal with people who initially appear charming or confident, brimming with ideas and enthusiasm, and we fall under their spell. Only when it is too late that we discover that their confidence is irrational and their ideas ill-conceived. What inevitably happens in these situations is that we are caught off guard, not expecting such behavior. Often these types will hit us with elaborate cover stories to justify their actions, or blame handy scapegoat.","title":"Laws of Human Nature"},{"content":"By nature, we humans shrink from anything that seems possibly painful or overtly difficult. We bring this natural tendency to our practice of any skill. Once we grow dept at some aspect of this skill, generally one that comes more easily to us, we prefer to practice this element over and over. Our skill becomes lopsided as we avoid our weaknesses. Knowing that in our practice we can let down our guard, since we are not being watched or under pressure to perform, we bring to this a kind of dispersed attention. We tend to be also quite conventional in our practice routines. we generally follow what others have down, performing the accepted exercises for these skills.\nResistance Practice The principle is simple: you go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice.\nFirst, you resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. You become your own worst critic; you see your work as if through the eyes of others.\nYou recognize your weaknesses, precisely the elements you are not good at. Those are the aspects you give precedence to in your practice. You should find a kind of perverse pleasure in moving past the pain this might bring.\nSecond, you resist the lure of eating up on your focus. You train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity, as if it were the real thing times two.\n In devising your own routines, you become as creative as possible. You invent exercises that work on your weaknesses. You give yourself arbitrary deadlines to meet certain standards, constantly pushing yourself past perceived limits. In this way you develop your own standards for excellence, generally higher than those of others.  Apprentice yourself in Failure Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. They tell you about your own inadequacies. It is hard to find out such things from people, as people are often political with their praise and criticisms. Your failures also permit you to see the flaws of your ideas, which are only revealed in the execution of them. You learn what your audience really wants, the discrepancy between your ideas and how they affect the public. Pay close attention to the structure of your group - how your team is organized, the degree of independence you have from the source of capital. There are design elements as well, and such management issues are often hidden sources of problems.\nTwo kinds of Failure The first comes from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid, or because you are waiting for the perfect time. This kind of failure you can never learn from, and such timidity will destroy you.\nThe second kind comes from a bold and venturesome spirit. If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your reputation is greatly outweighed by what you learn. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. It is a curse to have everything go right on your first attempt. You wil fail to question the element of luck, making you think that you have the golden touch. When you do inevitably fail, it will confuse and demoralize you past the point of learning. To apprentice as an entrepreneur you must act on your ideas as early as possible, exposing them to the public, a part of you even hoping that you\u0026rsquo;ll fail. You have everything to gain.\nCombine the \u0026lsquo;How\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;What\u0026rsquo; We humans live in two worlds. First, there is the outer world of appearances - all of the forms of things that captivate our eyes. But hidden from our view is another world - how these things actually function, their anatomy or composition, the parts working together and forming the whole. This second world is not so immediately captivating. It is harder to understand. It is not something visible to the eye, but only to the mind that glimpses the reality. But this \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo; of things is just as poetic once we understand it - it contains the secret of life, of how things move and change.\nThe division between the \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;what\u0026rsquo; can be applied to almost everything around us - we see the machine, not how it works; we see a group of people producing something as a business, not how the group is structured or how the products are manufactured and distributed.\nIn overcoming this division, in combining the \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;what\u0026rsquo; of architecture, we gain a much deeper, or rather more rounded knowledge of the field. He grasped a larger portion of the reality that goes into making buildings. This allowed him to create something infinitely more poetic, to stretch the boundaries, to break the conventions of architecture itself.\nScientists and technicians live in their own world, focusing mostly on the \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo; of things. Others live in the world of appearances, using these things but not really understanding how they function.\nJust before this split occurred, it was the ideal of the Renaissance to combine these two forms of knowledge. This is why the work of Leonardo da Vinci continues to fascinate us, and why the Renaissance remains an ideal. This more rounded knowledge is the way of the future, especially now that so much more information is available to all of us. We must make ourselves study as deeply as possible the technology we use, the function of the group we work in, the economics of our field, its lifeblood. We must constantly ask the questions - how do things work, how do decisions get made, how does the group interact?\nAdvance through Trial and Error Each age tends to create a model of apprenticeship that is suited to the system of production that prevails at the time. In the Middle Ages, during the birth of modern capitalism and the need for quality control, the first apprenticeship system appeared, with its rigidly defined terms. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the idea of developing yourself from within a particular field, as Darwin did in biology. This suited the growing spirit of the time.\nThe model goes like this: You want to learn as many skills as possible, following the direction that circumstances lead you to, but only if they are related to your deepest interests. Like a hacker, you value the process of self-discovery and making things that are of the highest quality. You avoid the trap of following one set career path. You are not sure where this will all lead, but you are taking full advantage of the openness of information, all of the knowledge about skills now at our disposal. You see what kind of work suits you and and what you want to avoid at all cost.\nYou move by trial and error. This is how you spend your twenties. You are the programmer of this wide-ranging apprenticeship, within the loose constraints of your personal interests. You are not wandering about because you are afraid of commitment, but because you are expanding your skill base and your possibilities. At a certain point, when you are ready to settle on something, ideas and opportunities will inevitably present themselves to you. In this new age, those who follow a rigid, singular path in their youth often find themselves in a career dead end in their forties, or overwhelmed with boredom.\nAbsorb the Master\u0026rsquo;s Power: the Mentor Dynamic Life is short, and your time for learning and creativity is limited. Without any guidance, you can waste valuable years trying to gain knowledge and practice from various sources. You must follow the example set by Masters throughout the ages and find the proper mentor. The mentor-protégé relationship is the most efficient and productive form of learning. the right mentors know where to focus your attention and how to challenge you. Their knowledge and experience becomes yours. They provide immediate and realistic feedback on your work, so you can improve more rapidly. Through an intense person-to-person interaction, you absorb a way of thinking that contains great power and can be adapted to your individual spirit. Once you have internalized their knowledge, you must move on and never remain in their shadow. Your goal is always to surpass your mentors in mastery and brilliance.\nWe live in a culture that likes to criticize and debunk any form of authority, to point out the weaknesses of those in power. If we feel any aura, it is in the presence of celebrities and their seductive personalities. To learn requires a sense of humility. We must admit that there are people out there who know our field much more deeply than we do. Their superiority is not a function of natural talent or privilege, but rather of time and experience.\nIf we are not comfortable with this fact, if we feel mistrustful for authority, we will succumb to the belief that we can just as easily learn something on our own, that being self-taught is more authentic. We might justify this attitude as a sign of our independence, but in fact it stems from basic insecurity. All that concern you in the early stages of your career is acquiring practical knowledge in the most efficient manner possible.\nAlmost all Masters and people of power suffer from too many demands on their time and too much information to absorb. If you can demonstrate the ability to help them organize themselves on these fronts to a degree that others cannot, it will be much easier to get their attention and interest them in the relationship. Try to see the world through their eyes and ask the simple question of what it is they need most. Keeping their self-interest involved enhance any emotional connection they feel toward you.\nIf you work on yourself first, developing a solid work ethic and organizational skills, eventually the right teacher will appear in your life. Word will spread through the proper channels of you efficiency and your hunger to learn, and opportunities will come your way. In any event, you should not feel timid in approaching Masters, no matter how elevated their position. You will be frequently surprised at how open they can be to serving as a mentor, if the fit is right and you have something to offer. The ability to transfer their experience and knowledge to someone younger often provides them with a great pleasure, akin to parenting.\nThe best mentors are often those who have wide knowledge and experience, and are not overly specialized in their field - they can train you to think on a higher level, and to make connections between different forms of knowledge.\nYou will want as much personal interaction with the mentors as possible. A virtual relationship is never enough. There are cues and subtle aspects you can only pick up through a person-to-person interaction. Tennis instructors can only reveal many secrets of their skills by demonstrating before their pupils' eyes. Instructors may not be conscious of what makes their backhand so effective, but in watching them in action pupils can pick up the pattern and motion, exploiting the power of mirror neurons. The same applies to mental jobs.\nAs the relationship progresses you can make this absorption process more conscious and direct, questioning them about the principles underlying their way of doing things. You can get them analyze their own creativity for you. They are grateful to reveal the inner workings of their power only to those they do not perceive as a threat.\nFind several mentors in your immediate environment, each one filling strategic gaps in you knowledge and experience. In our culture, we tend to venerate those who seem rebellious or at least strike the pose. But rebellion has no meaning or power if it occurs without something solid and real to rebel against. The mentor gives you just such a standard from which you can deviate and establish your own identity. You internalize the important and relevant parts of their knowledge, and you apply the knife to what has no bearing on your life.\nStrategies for deepening the Mentor Dynamic  One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\n Although you must submit to the authority of mentors in order to learn from and absorb their power to the highest degree, this does not mean you remain passive in the process.\nThe choice of the right mentor is more important than you might imagine. Because so much of her future influence upon you can be deeper than you are consciously aware of, the wrong choice can have a net negative effect upon your journey to mastery.\nTo reach mastery requires some toughness and a constant connection to reality. As an apprentice, it can be hard for us to challenge ourselves on our own in the proper way, and to get a clear sense of our own weaknesses. The times that we live in make this even harder. Developing discipline through challenging situations and perhaps suffering along the way are no longer values that are promoted in our culture. People are reluctant to tell each other the truth about themselves - their weaknesses, their inadequacies, flaws in their work.\nIt seems abusive or damaging to people\u0026rsquo;s self-esteem to offer them stern, realistic criticism, to set the tasks that will make them aware of how far they have to go.\nSpecific knowledge - Reading people You need to train yourself to pay less attention to the words that people say and greater attention to their tone of voice, the look in their eye, their body language - all signals that might reveal a nervousness or excitement that is not expressed verbally. Cutting off your interior monologue and paying deep attention, you will pick up cues from them that will register with you as feelings or sensations. Trust these sensations - they are telling you something that you will often tend to ignore because it is not easy to verbalize.\nIt is interesting to observe how people behave around those in positions of power and authority. they will reveal an anxiety, a resentment, or a sycophantic falseness that betrays something essential about their psychological makeup, something that goes back to their childhoods and that can be read in their body language.\nWhen you drop your defense mechanisms and pay deep attention to others, you will need to lower your guard and open yourself up to their influence as well. As long as your emotions and empathy are directed outward, you will be able to detach yourself when necessary and analyze what you have gleaned. Resist the temptation to interpret what they say or do as somehow implicitly involving you - this will cause you to turn your thoughts inward and close off the immediacy of the connection.\nExercise After you have known people for a while, try to imagine that you are experiencing the world from their point of view, placing yourself in their circumstances and feeling what they feel. Look for any common emotional experiences - a trauma or difficulty you\u0026rsquo;ve had, that resembles in some way what they are going through. Your ability to empathize with others is related to the creative process of feeling your way into the subject you are studying. Your goal is to figure out the hidden motives behind them, which will often revolve around power.\nIn general, you are reading and decoding every possible sign - the clothes they war and the organized or disorganized nature of their workspace. The choice of mate or partner can be quiet eloquent too, particularly if it seems slightly inconsistent with the character they try to project. In this choice they can reveal unmet needs from childhood, a desire for power and control, a low self-image, and other qualities they seek to disguise.\nWhat might seem like small issues: chronically being late, insufficient attention to detail, not returning any favors on your part, are signs of something deeper about their character. These are patterns you must pay attention to. Nothing is too small to notice. People have trained themselves to appear a certain way; they have a persona they use in public that acts like a second skin to protect them. Unless you are incredibly perceptive, you will tend to mistake the mask for the reality. Often it is the quiet ones, those who give out less at first glance, who hide greater depths, and who secretly wield greater power.\nWhat yo want is a picture of a person\u0026rsquo;s character over time, which will give you a far more accurate sense of their true character than any first impression could. So restrain yourself from the natural tendency to judge right away, and let the passing months reveal more and more about who people are, as you get better at reading them.\nYour goal is to identify and pierce through to what makes people unique, to understand the character and values that lie at their cores. the more you can fathom about people\u0026rsquo;s pasts and their way of thinking about things, the more you deeply you can enter into their spirit.\nYou will encounter thousands of various individuals in your life, and the ability to see them as they are will prove invaluable. People are in a state of continual flux. You must observe them and bring your readings of them up to date.\nSeven Deadly Realities In a group setting, there will be people who have one or more of these qualities to a high enough degree that they can become very destructive. People do not like to display these traits publicly because they are seen as ugly and undesirable.\nEnvy It is our nature to constantly ourselves to others. We will naturally experience some envy, but often we will find a way to minimize it because it is an unpleasant emotion. Seething with envy, the only way to discharge it is to find a way to obstruct or sabotage the person who elicited the emotion. Envy is very difficult to discern, and the most prudent course of action is to make sure your own behavior does not trigger it.\nIf you have a gift for a certain skill, you should make a point of occasionally displaying some weakness in other area, avoiding the great danger of appearing too perfect, too talented. If you are dealing with insecure types, you can display great interest in their work and even turn to them for advice. Self-deprecating humor will work wonders as well. In general, it is by standing out too much that you will spark this ugly emotion, and so it is best to maintain a nonthreatening exterior and to blend in well with the group, at least until you are so successful it no longer matters.\nConformism Those who are markedly different make them feel uncomfortable and insecure, calling the values of the dominant culture into question, This culture will have unwritten standards of correctness that shift with the times we live in. Often unconsciously conforming to the spirit of whoever on top, members will share the same values about morals or politics. You can become aware of this group spirit by observing how much people feel the need to display certain opinions or ideas that conform to the standards. If you have a rebellious or naturally eccentric streak, as is often the case with those who are aiming for mastery, you must be careful in displaying your different too overtly, particularly in the Apprenticeship Phase.\nLet your work subtly demonstrate your individual spirit, but when it comes to matters of politics, morals, and values, make a show of adhering to the accepted standards of your environment. Think of the workplace as a kind of theater in which you are always wearing a mask.\nRigidity When facing against complicated situations, we create habits and routines that give us a sense of control. We prefer what is familiar - ideas, faces, procedures - because they are comforting. Those who are entrenched in the old ways will fight to the death to preserve them. It is against human nature to consider alternative ways of thinking or doing things. If you are an adventurous, open-minded type, your very spirit will prove disruptive and upsetting. If you are not ware of the dangers of butting up against this fear of the new, you will create all sorts of hidden enemies, who will resort to anything to conserve the old order.\nSelf-obsessiveness We think of ourselves first. The world is a harsh and competitive place, and we must look after our own interests. Often those who are the most self-absorbed will surround their actions with a moral or saintly aura, or will make a show of supporting all of the right causes. confused by these appearances, when it is time to ask such people for assistance, you will often appeal to their sense of gratitude, their seemingly charitable nature, or their friendly feelings.\nLaziness Flightiness Passive Aggression Social intelligence All of us have social flaws of some sort, ranging from the relatively harmless to those that can get us in trouble. It could be we talk too much, or are too honest in our criticisms of people, or take offense too easily when others do no respond positively to our ideas. If we repeat bad behaviors often enough, we tend to offend people without ever really knowing why.\nFirst, we are quick to discern the mistakes and defects of others while being too emotional and insecure to look squarely at our own. People see our behavior from the outside, and their view of us is never what we imagine it to be. To have the power to see ourselves through the eyes of others would be of immense benefit to our social intelligence. We could begin to correct the flaws that offend, to see the role we play in creating any kind of negative dynamic, and to have a more realistic assessment of who we are.\nIt is best to start with events that are at least several months old, so we are not emotionally charged. We must focus on what we did that triggered or worsened the dynamic. We might begin to see a pattern that indicates a particular flaw in our character. Seeing these events from the perspective of the other people involved will loosen the lock our emotions have on our self-image, and help us understand the role we play in our own mistakes. We can also elicit opinions from those we trust about our behavior, reassure them that we want their criticisms. Slowly, we can develop increasing self-detachment, which will yield us the other half of social intelligence - the ability to see ourselves as we really are.\nCulture plays a larger role than we might imagine in how we think and communicate.\nAll of us have social flaws of some sort, ranging from the harmless to those that can get us in trouble. Talk too much, too honest in our criticism, take offense too easily. We are quick to discern the mistakes and defects of others, but we get too emotional and insecure to look at our own. People rarely tell us the truth about what it is that we do wrong. It becomes very difficult for us to perceive our flaws, let alone correct them.\nTo have the power to see ourselves through the eyes of others would be of immense benefit to our social intelligence. We could begin to correct the flaws that offend. Seeing these events from the perspective of the other people involved will loosen the lock our emotions have on our self-image, and help us understand the role we play in our own mistakes. We can develop increasing self-detachment, which will yield us the other half of social intelligence: the ability to see ourselves as we really are.\nFools We can classify people as fools by the following rubric: they place more importance on short-term matters - grabbing immediate money, getting attention from the public or media, and looking good. They are ruled by their ego and insecurities. They tend to enjoy drama and political intrigue for their own sake. They are more interested in their career and position than in the truth. You can distinguish them by how little they get done, or by how hard they make it for others to get results. They lack a certain common sense, getting worked about things that are not really important while ignoring problems that will spell doom in the long term. The natural tendency with fools is to lower yourself to their level. They annoy you, get under your skin, and draw you into a battle. In the process, you feel petty and confused. You lose a sense of what is really important. You can\u0026rsquo;t win an argument or get them to see your side or change their behavior, because rationality and results don\u0026rsquo;t matter to them. You simply waste valuable time and emotional energy.\nIn dealing with fools you must adopt the following philosophy: they are simply a part of life, like rocks or furniture. All of us have foolish sides, moments in which we lose our heads and think more of our ego or short-term goals. It is human nature. Seeing this foolishness within you, you can accept it in others. This will allow you to smile at their antics, to tolerate their presence as you would a silly child, and to avoid the madness of trying to change them. It is all part of the human comedy, and it is nothing to get upset about or lose sleep over. This attitude - \u0026ldquo;Suffer Fools Gladly\u0026rdquo; - should be forged in your Apprenticeship Phase, during which you are almost certainly going to encounter this type. If they are causing you trouble, you must neutralize the harm they do by keeping a steady eye on your goals and what is important, and ignoring them if you can.\nWhen it comes to practical life, what should matter is getting long-term results, and getting the work done in as efficient and creative a manner as possible. It is wise to try to gain the rudiments of social intelligence - to be able to read and recognize the sharks, and to charm and disarm difficult people. Your conscious attempt to opt out of the system will retard your apprenticeship in social intelligence and can make you vulnerable to the worst forms of naivete.\n It is a great folly to hope that other men will harmonize with us; I have never hoped this. I have always regarded each man as an independent individual, whom I endeavored to understand with all his peculiarities, but from whom I desired no further sympathy. In this way have I been enabled to converse with every man, and thus alone is produced the knowledge of various characters and the dexterity necessary for the conduct of life.\n  JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE\n Awaken the dimensional mind Masters and those who display a high level of creative energy are people who manage to retain a sizeable portion of their childhood spirit despite the pressures and demands of adulthood. This spirit manifests itself in their work and in their ways of thinking. Children are naturally creative. They transform everything around them, play with ideas and circumstances, and surprise us with the novel things they say or do.\nMaster not only retain the spirit of the Original Mind, but they add to it their years of apprenticeship and an ability to focus deeply on problems or ideas. This leads to high-level creativity. Although they have profound knowledge of a subject, their minds remain open to alternative ways of seeing and approaching problems. Like children, they are capable of thinking beyond words - visually, spatially, intuitively - and have greater access to preverbal and unconscious forms of mental activity, all of which can account for their surprising ideas and creations.\nSome people maintain their childlike spirit and spontaneity, but their creative energy is dissipated in a thousand directions, and they never have the patience and discipline to endure an extended apprenticeship. Others have the discipline to accumulate vast amounts of knowledge and become experts in their field, but they have no flexibility of spirit, so their ideas never stray beyond the conventional and they never become truly creative. Such a mind is not constricted by limited experience or habits. The Dimensional Mind is active, transforming everything it digests into something new and original, creating instead of consuming. What kills the creative force is not age or a lack of talent, but our own spirit, our own attitude. We become too comfortable with the knowledge we have gained in our apprenticeships. We prefer to live with familiar ideas and habits of thinking, but we pay a steep price for this: our minds go dead from the lack of challenge and novelty; we reach a limit on our field and lose control over our fate because we become replaceable.\nPrerequisites One, a high level of knowledge about a field or subject; and two, the openness and flexibility to use this knowledge in new and original ways. The knowledge that prepares the ground for creative activity largely comes from a rigorous apprenticeship in which we have mastered all of the basics. The problem of us all is that the knowledge we gain in the Apprenticeship Phase can become a prison. It locks us into certain methods and forms of thinking that are one-dimensional. Instead, the mind must be force from its conservative positions and made active and exploratory.\nChoose the proper Creative Task, the kind of activity that will maximize our skills and knowledge.\nLoosening and opening up the mind through Creative Strategies\nCreate the optimal mental conditions for a Breakthrough or Insight\nBe aware of the Emotional Pitfalls: complacency, boredom, grandiosity, and the like.\nCreative task Alter your concept of creativity by truing to see it from a new angle.

Review of how I\u0026rsquo;m spending my Time Awareness  an awareness of how you experience time can tell you a lot about yourself Objective: balance your consumption of time in a way that meshes goals and passions. keeping a journal sensitizes you as to how you are spending your depreciating asset: the hours of your life if you do not have an awareness of how you are spending time, you have no ability to manage your time effectively  Goals  What are your goals?\n  What do you hope to accomplish in the short term?\n  What do you want your life to look like in the long term?\n  How do you plan on getting from where you are to where you want to be?\n  What are the steps from here to there?\n Goals provide the road map   By thinking about steps and time, you engage your analytical and creative juices. You have a better understanding of what you have to do to get where you want to be.\n  You are starting to plan. You are starting to actually visualize the achievment of your goals. Visualization increases desire which increases intensity.\n  You are testing your resolve. By identifying specific steps and time requirements, you double check your intensity for certain goals.\n  Choices  You need to find a balance between living for the moment: doing exactly what you want to do right now. And living for the future: putting yourself in a position to lead the life you want at some point down the road. time management is in large part about choices. calls from friends. the desire to sleep late. commitments and obligations. seduction of the internet.   Successful people do not enjoy doing the things that others do not. Successful people simply do them nevertheless.\n  by constantly reflecting on your goals and readjusting at times,you increase the probability that your life will proceed on your agenda, and not someone else\u0026rsquo;s or by fate.    The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you. If you do that, you\u0026rsquo;re in control of your life. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, life controls you.\n Using the hours you have to maximum effectiveness  not all hours are created equal no magic: exercise daily, eat healthy, get lots of fluids, moderate your intake of caffeine and alcohol. use the time when you have the most energy. The power of Full engagement  create time  downtime periods: times when you are waiting for something to happen and when you you are cooling your heels.  minimize time waste  make decisions quickly speed reading improve memorization skills  improve memorization skills  stretch your mind: do activities that forces you to push yourself mentally spread out your intake of food and drink: when you overload yourself with food and/or drink, your sugar level spikes. and then shortly drops dramatically. exercise: increases blood flow to the brain antioxidants: berries, broccoli, spinach. learn memory skills, perform associations/rhymes get enough sleep concentrate convert important facts into a format that assists your recall. dont stress about memory skills  procrastination  result of a powerful law: INERTIA in order to achieve forward motion, people need to push themselves  strategies to defeat procrastination  keep a piece of paper or index card in your pocket with your goals written in bold ink: break big projects up into manageable pieces: most of us are overwhelmed when contemplating a huge project. train your mind to recognize the first signs of laziness or procrastination: always carry a means of taking notes: putting your thoughts in writing will help propel you into action the next chance you have to get started  use INERTIA to your advantage   people who develop the mental strength and fortitude to deal with procrastination and the other challenges we all face are most likely to achieve their dreams\n  those who develop mental strength are more likely to:\n 1. keep on schedule/plan 2. make appropriate choices 3. maintain good focus 4. defeat procrastination    develop strong mental fortitude  you are not your mind. you have dominion over negative thoughts in your head: read The power of now    The single most important step you can take is to learn to disidentify from you mind. At some point you will smile at the thoughts in your mind, as if they are antics of a small child.\n Eckhart Tolle The power of now    thoughts are things just like any other tangible item your brain can only process one dominate thought at a time: when you feel a thought creeping into your mind, train yourself to think of something else: a strong positive image or idea  Clutter the enemy of productivity  the part of your brain that holds all of the incomplete, undecided and unorganized stuff has limited capacity. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to get distracted. you want a mind like water  Effective time management make your work area attractive  equip it with everything you need to work: you should enjoy spending time in your work area. Everything you want and need should be near at hand.  Create a filing system  putting all material relevant to a subject in one place is a huge step to better time management and organization  ONE LIST  that you use to write or type EVERYTHING that requires your attention.  move every item   as much as possible, every piece of paper, email, text or voice message should be acted on\n  anything that you can do in two minutes or less, do it now\n  make a decision to\n 1. act on it immediately 2. toss or delete it 3. put it in your ONE LIST    convert thoughts to action steps  no more \u0026lsquo;consider\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;analyze\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;think about\u0026rsquo;. Put down exactly what you\u0026rsquo;ll do: read about, speak to, make decision about.  maintain a good tickler system  any reliable method that reminds you what you need to do and when  review weekly your systems for retention and productivity  are your systems working as well as they should?  revisit long-term goals at least once a month  are you making the right choices on a regular basis to move yourself close to your goals.  Planning  you should spend at least 10 minutes to plan each of your days by taking just ten minutes to reflect on what it is that you want to accomplish and how to do so. you will improve the odds that what you want to happen will happen by thinking ahead, you are likely to reduce the effort you need to complete whatever task in in front of you.   Questions to think as you plan  What is it that I want to accomplish today? How much time do I have to do that? Can I defer doing some items which are not important to another day? Is there a logical order to doing what I need to get done  todo list why to do lists work organizing your time  by forcing yourself to make a todo list, you are organizing your time. You are thinking through all that you need to get done and writing it down. By thinking about what needs to be done and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t, you create a framework for your day.  reduce stress  having a todo list reduces your stress. When you organize your days, your stress maybe reduced just by seeing your day visually  daily exercise in goal setting and choice making  requires you to rethink how you are spending your time and why  fun  it\u0026rsquo;s like writing a mini-novel with the main character being you. what you list is an act of creative Planning  Prioritizing  success is not an accident. Success is the result of repeatedly doing those things that optimize the probability of a favorable outcome  habits  too many people prioritize by reaction - doing what is pressing- rather than by proaction doing what is important. be careful that you are not being busy in place of effective.  prioritization quadrants            Important and Urgent Important, but not Urgent    Urgent, but not Important not Urgent and not Important     successful time management requires proaction. On How to take control of your time and life, Alan Lakein suggested that we start the day contemplating what we need to get done and rank them from A to C.   always tackle the hardest project first the squeaky wheel gets the grease. It means that the person or chore that makes the most immediate or noisiest demand gets attention.  streamlining  the best way to accomplish a goal is to work exclusively at that goal until you complete   In the strictest sense you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be trying to do more in each day, trying to fill every second with a work fidget of some type. It took me a long time to figure this out. I used to be very fond of the results-by-volume approach.\n Tim Ferris Four hour work week   incorporate the 80-20 rule into our lives  define 1 goal. List 5 things that I\u0026rsquo;m doing to achieve that goal which of those 5 things I\u0026rsquo;m doing is most likely to help that\u0026rsquo;s the thing to give most energy and attention to  focus  more focus by fewer distractions you can\u0026rsquo;t multitask  techniques  learn to discard quickly and without guilt make an immediate decision what to do put every piece of paper, book or article that pertains to a single project in one place pick two times a day to answer voice messages, texts or emails wear a watch keep handy some mechanism for taking down ideas that pop into my head during the day speed reading ask for help finish a task in one sitting or segment of time move on   speed reading  read first sentence of every paragraph read all words in bold, underlined or italicized read just the introductory and conclusion chapters or paragraphs scan vertically, not horizontally no mouthing don\u0026rsquo;t reread until finish a page or several paragraphs, only if you think you missed something  Conclusion  self-awareness is the sine qua non. keep a time journal for a week or so. watch for areas where you might re-allocate your time expenditures. goal-setting is the first step: there is no point to worrying about the passage of time unless and until you have identified those goals or objectives you are trying to achieve choices are tough: ultimately about making choices. you can create time by turning unproductive time into productive time. Increase your energy with exercise and healthy eating. The more energy you bring to an hour, the more powerful that hour becomes in moving you toward the realization of your goals. procrastination is the enemy aim for \u0026lsquo;a mind like water\u0026rsquo;. Declutter your work area, your life and eventually your mind, you increase your effectiveness dramatically. planning and preparation are worth the effort prioritize: separate necessary from accessory single-minded focus: distractions are dream killers. They dilute your braininess. When you decide to work, then work, and do not let interruptions from third parties interfere with the effort. pick and choose the time management techniques that work for you.

can grab your attention automatically, usually something salient to your survival, with evolutionary origins.\n  if we have a filter for\n  attention overload as a serious problem\n  we\u0026rsquo;re expected to do shadow work - the work of the companies for them.\n     have you ever sat in an airplan or train, just staring out the window with nothing to read, looking at nothing in particular? you might have found that time passed pleasantly.\n  you might have had a smilar feeling the last time you sat by the ocean or a lake, leeting your mind wander, and experiencing the relaxing feeling it induced. in this state, thoughts move seamlessly from one to another, there\u0026rsquo;s a merging of ideas, visual images, and sounds, of past, present, and future. thoughts turn inward - loosely connected, stream-of-consciousness thoguhts so much like the nighttime dream state that we call them daydreams\n  ths special brain state is marked by the flow of connections among disparate ideas and thoguhts, and a relative lack of barriers between sense and concepts. this network exerts a pull on consciousnessl it eagerly shifts the brain into mind wandering when\n  its discovery - a special brain network that supports a more fluid and nonlinear mode of thinking\n  it has taken over when you find you\u0026rsquo;ve been reading several pages in a book without registering their content, or when you are driving on a long stretch of highway and suddenly realize you havent' been paying attention to where you are and you missed your exit.\n  if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever stopped what you were doing to picture the conseunce of some future action or to imagine yourself in a particular future encounter, maybe your eyes turned up or down in your head from a normal straight-ahead gaze, and you became preoccupied with thought.\n  this is the default mode. this mode is a resting brain state, when your brain is not evnaged in a purposeful task. it\u0026rsquo;s not just that you can\u0026rsquo;t hold on to any one thought from the rolling stream, it\u0026rsquo;s that no single thought is demanding a response.\n  when you\u0026rsquo;re intensely focused on a task such as doing your taxes.\n  there are two brain states form a kind of yin-yang: when one is active, the other is not. during demanding tasks, the central executive kicks in,.\n  the phrase paying attention is a well-worn figurative language. atention has a cost. in a zero-sum game. we pay attention to one thing, either through conscious decision or because our attentional filter deemed it important enough to push it to the forefront of attentional focus.\n  people have focused on mapping the parts of the brain with different activities: tennis, music, perform mathematical calcualtions.\n  language ability does not reside in a specific region of the brain; it comprises a distributed network. the mind-wandering mode works in opposition to the central executive mode: when one is activated, the other is deactivated.\n  in our mind-wandering mode, our thoughts are mostly directed inward to our goals, desires, feelings, plans, and also our relationship with other people. there is a clear evolutionary advantage to beinbg able to stay on task and concentrate, we can switch\n  the orbital and prefrontal areas are responsible for things like planning, scheduling, and impulse control, and the supplementary motor area is responsible for initiating movement.\n  the inner dialuge is generated by the planning centers of your brain in the prefontal cortex, and the questions are being answered by other parts of your brain that possess the info\n  consciousness is a continuum of different states. the more accurate neural descriptions is that many networks of neurons are firing, much like the network of telephones simultaneously ringing in a busy office.\n  if you\u0026rsquo;re driving along and your thoguhts start to wander, this is the system that snaps to when a large truck suddenly crosses over into your lane, and gives you a shot of adrenaline at the same time.\n  ADHD drugs can block noreadrenaline release, and in turn block your alerting to warning signals\n  if you\u0026rsquo;re a sonar operator in asubmarine, you want your alerting system to be function at full capacity.\n  where memory comes from   parts of the brain can fall asleep for a few moments or longer without our realizing it. at any given moment,\n  many things get lost when we are not attending to the moment putting them down. to train ourselves to a zen-like focus living in the moment, of paying attention to whenever we put things down or put things away.\n  theory: many memories we\u0026rsquo;ve experienced are in there.\n memory is unreliable because the untrained brain has a crappy filling system. it takes everything that happens to you and throws it all willy-nilly into a big dark cloest.\n  when we experience any event, a nuique network of neurosn is activated depending on the nature of the event. neurons fire for face recognition for the players , motion detection for the movements of their bodies the act of remembering something is a process of bringing back on line those neurons that ere involved in the original experience. once we get those neurons to become active in a fashion similar to how thery were dying the original event, we experience the memory as lower-resolution replay of the original event. the remembering is imperfect: the instructions for which neurons need to be gathered and how exactly they need to fire are weak and degraded, leading to a simulacrum of the real experience.    thus our memory tends to be poor most of the time, not because the limited capacity of our brains to store the info but because of the nature moemory retrieval,\n  the biggest problem in humanity is that we dont know when were recalling things inaccurately. of often have a strong feeling of certainty that accompanies an incorrect, distorted memory. the more we can externalize memory throught physical records outthereintheworld, the less we must rely on our overvonfident, underprecise memoryu.\n  the best remembered- experiences are disinctive/unique or have a strong emotional component.\n  the reason why it is difficult to remember what you ate for breakfast two thursdays ago is that there is nothing special about that breakfast.\n  memory retrieval requires our brains to sift throught mutlille, competing instances to pick out just the ones we are trying to recollect.\n  having breakfast served to you in bed on your twenty-first birthday by a new, naked, romantic partner is even more unusual.\n  we need to remember unique or disintivive events because theyu represnet a potential change in the world around us or our undretstanding of it.\n  if something made us incredibly frightrend, elated, sad, or angry: we are more likely to remember it.\n  fuzzy categories are instantiated biologically in the brain, being able to create, use, and understand both kinds of categoes is something that our brains are hardwired to do.\n  people at the top of their professions, in particular those known for their creativity and effectiveness, use system of atttention and memory external to their brain as much as they can. a lot of the muse low tech solution for keeping on top of things..\n  when alen made a big list of everthing that was on his mind, he felt more lexaed and better able to focus on his work. if an boligation remained recorded only mentally. some part of me constantly kept thinking that it should be attended to, creating a situation that was inherntly stressful and unproductive.\n  the constant nagging in your mind of\n  your brain needs to engage on some consistent basis with all of your commitments activitites.\n  small tasks  the brain we need to rely on for staying on task is easily distracted multitasking activates the reward-seeking centers of the brain, casusing a burst of endogenous opioids little decisions take up as much energy as big ones. one of the first things we lose is impulse control. after making lots of insignificant decisions, we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important we are sacrificing efficiency and deep concentration when we interrupt our priority activities with email. we feel a sense of accomplishment after doing small tasks. the secret is to put systems in place to trick ourselves into staying on task when we need them to. experts receommend that you do email only two or three times a day. in concerted clumps rather than as they.  pratical   3 x 5 system\n  one idea or task per card. this ensures that you can easily find it and dispose of it when it\u0026rsquo;s been dealth with. one piee of information per card allows for rapid sorting and resorting.\n  the idea of the index cards, makes them preferable to fullsize sheets of paper because they provide greater random access.\n  once you have a stack, you make it a point to sort them regularly .\n  the names of categories arent imporant. its the pricess f external categorization.\n  if you can attend to one of the things on your list in less than two minutes do it now. if a task can be done by someone else. delegate it. anything that takes more than two mintes, defer.\n  you can keep these things all in your brain. but not effective.\n  people who use the index card system find it liberating.\n  some of the best ideas you\u0026rsquo;ll have come tin when youre doing something unrelated. you dont need to carry all the cards with you everywhere of course. priorities change and the rndom access nature of thecards means you can put them whenver they will be the most useful.\n  category  do it delegate it defer it drop it  organizing our homes affordances  simple affordances for the objects of our lives can rapidly ease the mental burden of trying to keep track of where they are. whenever you are home, that is where they keys should be. the big rules in not losing things is the rule of the designated place. spend as much as you can on decor that holds things. affordances if youll forget to buy milk on the way home, put an empty milk carton on the seat next to you in the car or in the backpack you carry to work on the subway. the brain is an exquisite change detector if the umbrella is by the door all the time, rain or shine, it no longer functions as  rules  1: a mislabeled item or location is worse than an unlabeled item if there is an existing standard, use it dont keep what you cant use  digital home  create different desktop patterns so visual cues help to remind you. if you\u0026rsquo;re working on two comletely separte projects, dedicate one desk or table of the house for each. stepping into a different space hits the reset button on your brain and allows for more productive and creative thinking computer: you can keep your files entirely unorganized and the search function will help you

folders wihin categories dont spend more time filing and classifying than you\u0026rsquo;ll reap on searching what do you love about being at home. that feeling of calm, secure control over how you

stay in touch with a vast array of friends   set a frequency you want to meet them. when the reminder ges off. you send them a text to check in.\n  external memory that includes other people is known as transactive memory, that includes the knowledge of who in your social network possesses the knowledge you seek.\n  a large part of organizing our social world successfully is identifying what we want from it. most of us want to feel that we fit in somewhere and art part of a group.\n  being alone for too long causes neurochemical changes that can result in hallucinations, depression, suicidal thoughts, violent behaviors, and even psychosis.\n  social isolation is also a risk factor for cardiac arrest and death.\n  although many of us think we prefer being alone, we dont know what we want.\n  there is comfort in belonging\n  our brains carry around a vestigial primordial longing to know where all these people in our lives ended up\n  we dont keep up with people whom we dont like or whose relevance to our lives diminish over time.\n  theres an illusion in all of this. social networking provides breadth but no depth. the online interaction works best as a supplement, not a replacement for inperson contact.\n  women are more focused than men on commitment and continuity of communication.\n  men on sexual and physical closeness\n  intimacy, love, and passion dont always go together - they belong to different multidimensional constructs\n  we have an innate tendency to deceive when it is in our own self-interest.\n  intimacy is a new thing. many of us ask more than ever of our romantic partners. we expect them to be there for emotional support, companionship, intimacy, and financil support, and we expect at various times they will function as confidante, nurse, sounding board, secretary, treasurer, parent, protector, guide, cheerleader, masseuse, and throught it all we expect them to be consistently alluring, sexully appealing, and to stay in lockstep with our own sexual appetites and preferences. we expect our partners to help us achive our full potential in life.\n  our increased desire for our partners to do all these things is rooted in a biological need to conenct deeply with at least one other person. when it is missing, making such a connection becomes a high priority. when that need is fulfilled by a satisfying intimate relationship, the benefits are both psychological and physiiological. people in a relationship experience better health, recover from illnesses more quickly, and live longer.\n  the presence of a satisfying intimate relationship is one of the strongest predictors of happiness and emotional well-being that has ever been measured. how do we enter into and maintain intimate relationships.\n  to be agreeable is to be cooperative, friendly, considerate, and helpful - attributes that are more or less stable across the lifetime, and show up early in childhood. we can control undesirable emotions such as anger and frustration.\n  children who receive positive reinforcement for impulse control and anger management become agreeable adults. being an aggreable person is a tremendous advantage for maintaing positive social relationships.\n   having a best friend during adolescence is an important part of becoming a well-adjusted adult. those without one are more likely to be bullied and marginalized and to carry these experiences into becoming a disagreeable adults.    having an aggreeable friend also protects social problems later in life.\n  on average, marriage partners tend to be similar in age, education level, and attractiveness.\n  the internet has helped some of us to become more social and to establish and maintain a larger number of relationships. for others, particularly heavy internet users who are introverted to begin with, the internet has led them to become less socially involved, lonelier, and more likely to become depressed. theres is a dramatic decline in empathy among college students. who apparently are far less likely to say that it is valuable to put oneself in the place of others or to try and understand their feelings. its because were spending more time alone under the illusion that theyr being social.\n  this streamlined access to a pool of thoudsands of potential partners can elicit an evaluative, assessment-oriented mindset that leads online daters to objectify potential partners and might even undermine their willingness to commit to one of them.\n  it can also cause people to make lazy, ill-advised deciosn due to cognitive and decision overload. consumers cant keep track of more than two or three variables of interest when evaluating a large number of alternatives. this is directly related to the capacity limitations of working memory.\n  its also related limitations of our attentional network. when considering dating alternatives, we need to get our minds to shuttle back and forth between the central executive mode: keeping track of all those little details, and the daydreaming mode: what our life would be like with them in our life, the mode in which we try to picture oursevles with each of the attractive alternatives.\n  that rapid switching between central executive calculating and dreamy mind0wandering depletes neural resources, leading us to make poor decisions. when cognitive resources are low, we have difficulty focusing on relevant information and ignoring the irrelevant.\n  staying in any commited monogamous relationship requires fidelity, or forgoing the forbidden fruit. this is known to be a function of the availability of attractive alternatives. stories of people who forgot to take their dating profile down after meeting and beginning a serious relationship with someone are legion.\n  online daters engage in deception.\n  once we are in a relationship, romantic or platonic, how well do know the people we care about. and how good are we at knowing their thoughts?\n  people lie for reasons: fear of reprisal, avoiding hurting other people\u0026rsquo;s feelings, whitelies to minimize antogonism. we are good at telling when people are lying and we go along with it.\n  a large part of social interaction requires that we subdue our innate primate hostilities in order to get along. one way of helping to keep learge numbers of humans living close proximity is through the use of nonconfrontational speech, or indirect speech acts. indirect speech acts dont say what we actually want, but they imply it. they are called implicatures\n  indirect speech acts are a powerful social glue that enables us to get along. the act of uttering an idirect speech act can be seen as inherently an act of play, an invitation to cooperate in a game of verbal hide-and-seek \u0026lsquo;do you understand what im saying?\u0026rsquo; they invoke in both the speaker and the hearer a shared representation of the world; they rely on shared background info that is both linguistic and social. by appealing to their shared knowledge, the speaker and listener are creating a pact and affirming their shared worldview.\n  social rejection causes activation in the same part of the brain as physical pain does. tylenol can reduce people\u0026rsquo;s experience of social pain.\n  the set of utterances that can so change the state of the world is limited, but they are powerful. we empower these legal or quasi-legal authorities in order to facilitate our understanding of the social world.\n  theres a hormone in the brain released by the back half of the pituitary gland, oxytocin. when a person has an orgasm, oxytocin is released, and of the effects of oxytocin is to make us feel bonded to others.\n  nature\u0026rsquo;s way of causing couples to want to stay together after sex to raise any children that might result from that sex. it is clearly an evolutionary advantage for a child to have two caring, nurturing parents. if the parents feel bonded to each other through oxytocin release, they are more likely to share in the raising of their children, thus propagating their tribe\n  oxytocin in idividuls with autism shows up at lower than normal levels, and the administration of oxytocin causes them to become more social, and improves emotion recognition.\n  oxytocin creates a feeling of trust\n  people who receive social support during illness recover more fully and more quickly.\n  levels of oxytocin also increase during gaps in social support or poor social functioning.\n  oxytocin regulates the salience of social information and is capable of eliciting positive and negative social emotions. its role is to organize social behavior.\n  nondrug therapies, such as music, may exert similar therapeutic effects via oxytocinergic regulation. music has been shown to increase oxytocin levels, esp when people listen to or play music together.\n  a related chemical in the brain, a protein called arginine vasopressin, regulate affiliation, sociability, and courtship.\n  vasopressin causes some murine species to behave \u0026lsquo;polygamously\u0026rsquo;\n  active ingredient marijuana activates cannabinoid receptors, which increases social activity\n  LSD stimulate dopamine and certain serotonine receptors\n  in order to feel socially connected to others, we like to think we know them, and to some extent we can predict their behavior.\n    we have a tendency to describe the people we know in trait terms: theyre extroverts or introverts, agreeable or not, the life of the party or stickinthemud in social psychology experiments. funcdamental attribution error: an additional part of the fundamental attribution error is that we fail to appreciate the roles people are forced to play in certain situations constrain their behavior. suppose youre walking down the halls of your office and pass a new coworker. you say hello and he doesnt respond. you could atribute his bahavior to a stable personality trait nd conclude that he is shy or that he is rude. or you could attribute his bahavior to a situational factor. the more cognitive load one is experiencing, the more likely one is to make errors in judgement about the causes of an individual\u0026rsquo;s bahavior.  on the edge of your social world  we tend to have a very difficult time ignoring info that has been shown later to be false. humans gossip for many reasons: it helps us feel suoerior to others when we otherwise feel insecure about ourselves. if tiffany is willing to join in the gossip with me against britney. humans tend to be innately suspicious of outsiders where and outsider is anyone different from us: religion, skin color, hometowm, the school from which we graduated, our income level, the political party we belong to, the kinds of music we listen to, highschoolers typically break into dozens of subcliques based on further partitioning of what constitutes people like us. this partitioning arises at a time when our brains and bodies are undergoing dramatic neural and hormonal changes. we tend to oversestimate the similarities of outgroup members a group will be perceived differently, and more accurately, by its own members than by outsiders ingroup and outgroup effects have a neurobiological basis. within an area of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex, theres a group of neurons that fire when we think about ourselves and poeple who are like us. due to exposure. were better able to engage the medial prefrontal cortex with ingroup members because their bahaviors are easier for our brains to visualize in all their nuance. it appears that the partitioning of people into mutually exclusive categories activates the perception that \u0026lsquo;we\u0026rsquo; are better than \u0026lsquo;they\u0026rsquo; even when there is no rational basis for it. thats just the way \u0026lsquo;we\u0026rsquo; are when we think about organizing our social world, the implication of ingroup/outgroup bias is clear. we have a stubborn tendency to misjudge outsiders and diminish our abilities to forge new, cooperative, and potentially valuable social relations. racism is a form of negative social judgement that arises from a combination of belief perseverance, outgroup bias, categorization error, and faulty inductive reasoning. in case of ingroup/outgroup bias, each group thinks of the other as homogeneous and monoithic, and each group views itself as variegated and complex the act of living in cities and towns together is an act of cooperation. various levels of gov pass laws to define civil behavior. we rely on each other not just to observe the law but to be basically helpful and cooperative beyond the law. social interactions are complex and a number of experiments have demonstrated that we tend either to act in our own self interest or just plain dont want to get involved. the tendency to not get involved is driven by three powerful, interrelated psychological principles.   strong desire to confrom to others' behavior in the hope that it will allow us to gain acceptance within our social group. to be seen as cooperative and agreeable. social comparison: we tend to examine our bahavior in terms of others diffusion of

supports this altruistic sentinel behavior. oxytocin - the same social affilitive hormone that increases trust and social cooperation among humans. try to be agreeable.  organizing our time   prefrontal cortex. more highly developed than other species. seed of many behaviors we consider distinctly human: logic, analysis, problem solving, good judgement, planning for the future, decision making.\n  CEO of the brain. extensive two-way connections between the prefrontal cortex and almost every other region of the brain place it in a unique position to schedule, monitor, manage, and manipulate nearly every activity we undertake.\n  one of the great achievements of the human prefrontal cortex is that it provides us with impulse control and the ability to delay gratification, something that most animals lack. children and adolescents are not good at planning or delaying gratification\n  dysexecutive syndrome: planning and time coordination deficits. utter lack of inhibition across a range behaviors, particularly in social settings. blurt out inappropriate remarks, go on binges.\n  if your inhibitions are reduced, youre impaired at seeing the future consequences of your actions. you tend to do\n  damage to the prefrontal cortex causes an inability to effectively go forward or backward in time in one\u0026rsquo;s mind. we get stuck in the present, doing something over and over again, perseverating, revealing a failure in temporal control.\n  they can be terrible at organizing their calendars and todo lists due to a double whammy of neural deficits. first, theyre unable to place events in the correct temporal order.\n  if you dont know you have it. youre liabke to go headlong into situations without taking proper precautions and end up in trouble.\n  advanced prefrontal cortex damage interferes\n  with the ability to make connections and associations between disparate thoguhts and concepts, resulting in a loss of creativity. esp important for generating creative acts in art and music. this is the region of the brain that is most active when creative artists are functioning at their peak.\n  most of us live in a goldilocks zone where everything is just right. thats when weplan our activities, follow through on our plans, and inhibit impulses that would take us off track.\n  the brain coordinates a large share of the body\u0026rsquo;s housekeeping and timekeeping functions - regulating heart rate and blood pressure, signaling whent its time to sleep and wake up, letting us know when were hungry or full, and maintaining body temperature even as the outside temperature changes.\n  higher cognitive functions of the brain handled by the cerebral cortex: reasoning, problem solving, language, music, precision athletic movement, mathematical ability, art, and the mental operations that support them: meory attention, perception, motor palnning, and categorization.\n  n=1 experiment playing music to an owl: neural firing pattern the same pattern of beats and ptiches that were in the original music\n  this includes relatively well-known neurochemicals: serotonin, dopamin, oxytocin, epinephrine, as well as acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, and endocannabinoids. chemicals are released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of info in the brain.\n  manufacturing these chicals, and dispersing them to regulate and modulte brain activity, requires energy: they get that energy from glucose. no other tissue in the body relies solely on glucose for energy except the testes.\n  eating or drinking glucose. chronic ingestion of sugars. can damage other systems and lead to diabetes and sugar crash.\n  the brain burns glucose as a car burns gasoline, fuel to mental operations.\n  most brain energy is used in synptic transmission in conneting neurons to one another and in turn connecting thoughts and ideas to one another.\n  the brain only takes in the world little bits and chunks at a time.\n  the brain picks and chooses and acticipates what it thinks is goin to be important, what you should pay attention to.\n  people who organize their time in a way that allows them to focus are going to get more done, less tired and less neurochemically depeted after doing it. daydreaming takes less energy than multitasking. multitasking by definition disrupts the kind of sustain thought needed for problem sovling and for creativity.\n  multitasking is bad for innovation. brain\u0026rsquo;s arousal system has a novelty bias, meaning that its attention can be hijacked easily by something new: humans will work as hard to obtain a novel experience as we will to get a meal or a mate.\n  the very brain region we need to rely on for stayin on task is easily distracted by shiny new objects.\n  in multitasking, we unknowingly enter anaddiction loopp as the brain\u0026rsquo;s novelty centers become rewarded for processing shiny new stimuli, to the detriment of our prefrontal cortex, which wants to stay on task and gain the rewards of sustained effort and attention.\n  trdeoff in multitasking comes down to focus vs creativity.\n  we consider a discovery to be creative if it explores new ideas through analogy, metaphor, or tying together things that we didnt realize were connected.\n  individuals who take dopamine-enhancing drugs such as methylphenidate report that it helps them to stay motivated to work, to stay focused, and to avoid distractions.\n  interesting gene: COMT. appears to modulate the ease with which people can switch tasks, by regulating the amount of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.\n  low dopamines in the prefrontal cortex: greater cognitive flexibility, easier task switching, more creativity than average.\n  high dopamne levels:less cognitive flexibility, difficulty task switching. many people who have ADD are more creative and that those who can stay very focused on task might be excelennt workers when following instructions but are not esp. creative.\n  prefrontal cortex damage: can lead to deficits both in event segmentation.\n  when we do complex tasks. our prefrontal cortex works with our hippocamus to build an ensemble of mental images of the finished outcome alongside mental mimages of the partly finished outcomes. also subconsciously picture what would happen if we did things out of order.\n  chunk  if i have something big i want to get done, break it into chunks: meaningful, implementable, doable chunks. theres the balance between doing and monitoring your progress. we work, we inspect the wor, we make adjustments, we push forward. the prefrontal cortex coordinates the compariosn of whats out there and whats in our head. we must constantly go back and forth between work and evaluation, comparing the ideal image in our head with the owkr in front of us. many many phd students fall into this categoru. never finishing their degrees because they cant move forward. planning and doing require separate parts of the brain. to be both a boss and a worker, one needs to form and maintain multiple ordered attentional sets and then bounce back and forth between them. it forms an executive attentional set for a task and then constructs a worker attentional set for doing the actual task the exec set cares only that the job is done and well. the worker gets down to we the mop and start the job. a good worker will be able to call uopn a level of attention subordinate to all that and momentarily become a kind of detail-oriented worker. if we dont plan, we might have to make high level decisions. all this level shifting, exec to worker, is a shifting of the attentional set and it comes with the metabolic cost of multitasking. by dividing up the roles in, workers dont have to gaf.  worker mode.  if you have chores to do, put similar chores together if clean house, just clean house. stay focused and maintain a single attentional set through to completion of a job. organizing our mental resources efficiently means providing slots in our schedules. allows us to get more done and finish up with more energy,  sleep  bimodal sleep: 2 rounds of sleep. first round of sleep occur 4 or 5 hours after dinner. followed by an awake period of one or more hours in the middle of the night. followed by a second period of four or five hours of sleep. bimodal sleep nap regime is healthier and promotes greater life satisfaction efficiency and performance. caffeine enhances cognitive function. but it only works best when ypu\u0026rsquo;ve bee

still wake up at a fixed time in the next morning. sleep in a cool, dark room. cover your windows if needed to keep out light.  naps  naps: beautiful, scrumptious, very much needed for worn-out neural circuits. naps longer than 40 mins are counterproductive. dont naps after hitting the snooze button or close to actual sleep time powernaps yield significant cognitive enhancement, improvement in memory, and increased productivity.  procrastinate  do the most unpleasant task the first thing in the morning to get it out of the way. willpower deplets as the day moves on. procrastination is a failure of self-regulation, planning, impulse control, or a combination of all 3. the tendency to procrastinate has been found to be correlated with certain traits, lifestyles, and other factors. younger and single are more likely to procrastinate. being outside in natural settings: parks, forests, the beach, the mountains, and the desert. replenished self-regulatory mechanisms in the brain. living or spending time in nature as opposed to urban environments reduce the tendency to procrastinate selective migration: large urban centers are associated with critical thinking and and creativity, and also procrastination. the increased bombardment of sensory info reduces the ability to enter the daydreaming mode, the mode that replenished the exec attention system. is there a brain region implicated in procrasination. procrastination resembles some of the temporal planning deficits we saw following prefrontal damage.  types  some of us procrastinate difficult or unpleasant tasks in favor of those that are more fun. others pursue unpleasant task in favor of those that are more fun or that yield an immediate reward.   the rest seeking procrastinators would generally rather not be exerting themselves at all. while the fun-task procrastinators enjoy being busy and active all the time. delayed gratification: activities with a long time to completion (long time to reward) are the ones more likely to be started late. and those with an immediate reward are less likely to be procrastinated humans have a low tolerance for frustration. when choosing what tasks to undertake or activities to pursue, we tend to choose not the most rewarding but the easisest. this means that unpleasant or difficult things get put off.   we tend to evaluate our self-worth in terms of our achievements. whether we lack self-confidence in general: or confidence that this particular project will turn out well. we procrastinate because that allows us to delay putting our reputations on the line until later.\n why?  our limbic system, and immediate-rewards-seeking parts of the brain contest with our prefrontal cortex. which all too well understands that consequenes of falling behind. both regions run on dopamine. but the dopamine has different actions in each. dopamine in the prefrontal cortex causes us to focus and stay on task. dopamine in the limbic system, along with the brain\u0026rsquo;s own endogenous opioids, causes us to feel pleasure. we put things off wehenver the desire for immediate pleasure wins out over our ability to delay gratification, depending on which dopamine system is in control some individuals suffer from initiaion deficits: cant start others fail to accomplish tasks on time because they cant finish maybe because of the lack of skills. maybe from perfectionism.  mindset  successful person sees each setback as an opportunity to gain additional knowlege to accomplish my goal success: \u0026lsquo;i thought i knew everything i needed to know to achieve my goals. but this has taught me that i dont. once i learn this, i can get back on track.\u0026rsquo; they expect a rocky life ahead. 2 subregions involved in self-assessment and judging own performance are dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the orbital cortex. self-confidence appears to have a genetic basis.   faulty beliefs  life should be easy our self-worth is dependent on our success if our self-confidence and the value of completing the task are both high, we\u0026rsquo;re less likely to procrastinate.  $$ \\textbf{procrastination } = \\frac{\\text{time to complete a task x distractability} }{\\text{self-confidence x task value}} $$\ncreativity  achieving insight across a wide variety of problems. first we focus all our attention on the aspects of the problem is it is presented (combing through different possible solutions and scenarios with our left prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate) second phase, we need to relax, let go of the problem, and let networks in the right hemisphere take over neurons in the right hemisphere are more broadly tuned, with longer branches and more dendritic spines. less precise but more connected. the moment preceding insight is accompanied by a burst of gamma waves. which bind together disparate neural networks, effectivelt binding thoughts that were seemingly unrelated into a coherent new whole.  maximize creativity  flow state: different state of being during flow, two key regions of the brai ndeactivate: the portion of the prefrontal cortex responsible for self-criticism, and the amygdala, the brain\u0026rsquo;s fear center.  flow state  attention is focused on a limited perceptual field, and that field receives your full concentration and complete investment action and awareness merge.you cease thinking about yourself as separate from the activity or the world, and you don\u0026rsquo;t think of your actions and your perceptions as being distinct: what you think becomes what you do. during flow, you experience freedom from worry about failure; you are aware of what needs to be done, but you don\u0026rsquo;t feel that you are doing it. the ego is not involved and falls away completely. flow is a lack of distractibility: the same old distractions are there, but we\u0026rsquo;re not tempted to attend to them. we monitor our performance without the kinds of self-defeating negative judgments flow states don\u0026rsquo;t occur for just any old task or activity. they can occur only when one is deply focused on the task, when the task requires intense concentration and commitment, provides immediate feedback, and is perfectly matched to one\u0026rsquo;s skill level if the task you are engaged in is too simple, holding no challenge, i\u0026rsquo;ll get bored. that boredom will break my attention to the task, and my mind will wander into the default mode. if the task is too difficult and holds too many challenges. i\u0026rsquo;ll become frustrated and experience anxiety. the greater my skill is, the greater the opportunity to achieve flow. the flow state is characterized by a total lack of conscious awareness, am erging of your self with the project itself, a seamless melding of thought, action, movment, and result. the higher your skill level, the more easily you can practive those skills automatically, subconsciously, and then the more easily you can disengage your conscioys mind, your ego, and other enemies of flow. easier for those who have invested a great deal of time to a given dopamin  what flow means  high level of engagement. info access and processing seem effortless. skills we didn\u0026rsquo;t know we had emerges. with no need to exercise self-control to stay focused, we free neural resources to the task at hand. during flow states, we no longer need to exert ourselves to stay on task: it happens automatically as we enter this specialized attentional state. it takes less energy to be in flow than to be distracted. this is why flow states are periods of great productivity and efficiency flow is a chemically different state. flow occurs when you are not explicitly thinking about what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. your brain is in a special mode of activity in which procedures and operations are performed automatically without your having to exert conscious control. trying to think about what you\u0026rsquo;re doing can quickly interferem ending the automaticity and high performance level you\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed.  flow can be disruptive  can become an addiction.  deep shit  when we think about our lives as a whole, we think whether we feel we made any contributions with our lives.   distractions  if you really need to get something done, give it to a busy person. a large part of efficient time management revolves around avoiding distractions an ironic part of life is that we are harmed by the things we desire the temptations that can disrupt our lives are pure indulgences. realizing when a diversion has gotten out of control is one of the great challenges of life. anything that tempts us to break the greatest life satisfaction comes from completing projects that require sustained focus and energy. to ignore distractions, we have to trick ourselves, or create system that helps us stick to the work two kinds of distractions we need to deal with are external and internal.  external  set aside a particular time of day to work. adopt the mental set that this thing you\u0026rsquo;re doing now is the most important thing you could be doing we have to rely on our own wits, and on the prefrontal cortex\u0026rsquo;s central executive. difficult tasks benefit from a sustainede period of concentration of fifty minutes or more, due to the amount of time it takes to settle into and maintain a focused state. best time-management technique is to ensure you have captured every single thing that has your attention, or should have your attention, by writing it down. then you can step back and look at your list from an observer standpoint and not let yourself be drivent by what\u0026rsquo;s the latest and loudest in your head. taking breaks is also important. getting up to walk around at least once every ninety minutes.  five-minute rule  things you can deal with now are better off being dealt with, rather than letting them accumulate. set aside a designated block of time to deal with all these little things.  calculate my time worth  do not spend more time on a decision than its worth.  organizing info for the hardest decisions  we\u0026rsquo;re faced with decisions every day that impact our livelihood, our happiness, and our health.  thinking straight about probabilities  cognitive science has taught us that relying on our gut or intuition often leads to bad decisions, esp. in cases where statistical info is avaialble part of maintaining an organized mind and orgnized life requires that we make the best decisions possible. bad decisions sap strength and energy.  categories of

Decision making is often very rapid, outside our conscious control, and involves heuristics and cognitive impulses that have evolved to serve us in a wide range of situations. Rationality in decision making is partly ilusory. humans are social creatures, and most of us unconsciously modify our behavior to minimize conflict with those around us. organizations that discuss ethics openly create a culture of adhering to ethical norms because it is \u0026lsquo;what everyone does around here\u0026rsquo; organizations that allow employees to ignore ethics form a breeding ground for bad behavior   Last lesson  The greatest scientists are artists as well.

Note that this post is literally me taking notes (more like copying verbatim) of what the author wrote and I have absolutely no rights to the material provided. Don\u0026rsquo;t @ me.\n The working class has experienced economic stagnation and precarity, and even life expectancy in the US, as well as ower family stability and civic engagement. Social mobility has declined, while inequality has widened. [the working class] has scarecely any political agency in the current system and no apparent means for acquiring any. At most, working-class voters can cast their votes but can exercise no influence on policy formation, agency personnel, governance areas (that have been trasnferred to technocratic bodies?) While a restive working class might provide fertile ground for political upheavals, any fundamental transformation of Western politics will necessarily be led by increasing numbers of the \u0026ldquo;elite\u0026rdquo; who defect and rethink their allegiance to establishment paradigms. 4.Conventional narratives, including many that are critical of the status quo, paint the elite as a unified block aligned with neoliberalism. But the neoliberal economy has created a profound fracture within the elite, the significance of which is just beginning to be felt. The socioeconomic divide that will determine the future of politics, particularly in the US, is not between the top X percent and the rest (1% vs 99%). The real class war is between the 0.1 percent and (at most) the 10 percent. Precisely, between elites primarily dependent on capital gains and those primarily dependent on professional labor. At bottom, the economy that has been constructed over the last few decades is nothing more than a capital accumulation economy. As long as returns on capital exceed returns on labor, then the largest capital holders benefit the most, inequality rises, and wealth becomes more and more narrowly concentrated. Marxian thinkers have been analyzing theses dynamics for almost two centuries, but they have often misread the political effects of these developments, which play out primariliy among the elite managerial class, rather than within the binary of capitalists and proletarians. Lost amid the celabrations of the \u0026ldquo;information economy\u0026rdquo; in recent decades is the fact that elite career trajectories are no longer what they used to be.  Big Law associate salaries at white-shoe firms remained flat from 2007 to 2016.\nFinance no longer delivers for the top 5% even though firm profits are high. average compensation for mid-level employees in sales and trading has fallen by half while investment banker salaries have been reduced by one-third\nhedge funds returns have been disappointing typical employees can enjoy a comfortable lifestyle but unlikely to accumulate sybstantioal capital themselves private equity is healthier but has become highly competitive and increasingly reliant on financial engineering gimmicks, such as selling companies between funds managed by the same firm\nWhat the fuck does this mean?\n In short, the effects of financialization on the real econ­omy are being replicated within the industry itself—the upward redistribution of rents within a context of overall deceleration.\n Silicon Valley  brightest star in the new economy universe.

Full disclaimer, I have not achieved a single thing that I wanted to do this year. It\u0026rsquo;s sad and pathetic but it\u0026rsquo;s also enlightening, I guess.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s enlightening in a way that most people I\u0026rsquo;ve met feel this way. The memes about doomers (or as boomers affectionately call them fuckin' entitled millenials/gen z) are true. We are sad. We are aimless. We spend more time on the phone than ever before. Our daily hit of dopamine probably comes from a popular social media platform.\nMost of us feel that we are not living up to our expectations and that we have to atone for it. While rationally I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that this is true, we haven\u0026rsquo;t seen but a modicum of how vast and beautiful this world is. Yet we, or at least I and my friends, condition ourselves to think of our personal developments as an ultimate truth in life. Anyday that we are not working toward that goal is a day wasted. In another word, we are taught to measure our self worth based on our contributions to the world. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be that bad if the byproduct of that thinking is a sense of dread and self-pity if we fail to achieve things we want.\nAt least that\u0026rsquo;s what I feel. But feel is an overloaded word. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like this as if this is a core belief of mine. I feel like this when I\u0026rsquo;m tired. I feel aimless like this when I\u0026rsquo;m not managing my time so that I can spend most of my time doing things that I find meaningful.\nTo put it in a way that most of my friends can relate, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing the logistics too long. I have been taking classes, learning soft skills, improving myself. Things like those surely lay a good foundation to everything, they are like the tutorial parts of a video game. But it is only there to make sure I know how to play a game. It is inherently unrewarding because its sole purpose is to guy players towards the meaningful part. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been grinding this tutorial for too long. Or is it? Who knows.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m saying is, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m barely touching the tips of the iceberg. Life is more than just waking up, going to class, going to the library to do homework, and writing a blogpost complaining how you\u0026rsquo;re tired of doing all of those for too long.\nBut of course, the whole thing that I just said is simply not true. I probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t treat my life as either meaningful or meaningless.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny, I know that what ever I think of right now. Somebody smarter and more educated had thought of this before and had written about it. They had probably come to a better conclusion. Well, I should treat this essay as a concretization of my little system of beliefs when I was 20. I should read more.\nIn a time of senselessness, what do I seek? Will it be Nietschze, will it be ancient Buddhist texts, will it be Netflix, a talk with one of my friends, or do I just power through all of this all by myself?\nGoddamn it, I hate meta questions. I just want to do something rewarding. Something that is beneficial in the long term. At the same time, though, I hate doing grudge work. Why? Because I only live once. I am entitled to wanting stuff and getting it.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Buddhishm. But I vaguely remember that the moment I\u0026rsquo;ve asked for the wrong thing, I would spend my life chasing the ephemeral stuff. Well guess what. I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to live my life the perfect way. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be a sponge.\nYeah you heard me.\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna be a sponge.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll listen to what people have to say.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll learn as much as I can.\nUgh, this whole essay just screams I need meds. But I\u0026rsquo;m not diagnosed with anything, yet. I might need some, though.\nAlso I\u0026rsquo;ll start a daily vlog and it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be sick.\n","permalink":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/post/cycle/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s meta, but I feel like no matter I do, I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to feel like how I want to feel.\nNot that I have achieved a lot and feel empty afterwards.

While I know close to nothing about him, I can imagine that most of his thoughts and actions stemmed from a systemic and practical approach.\nI remember reading him stating that while he takes a certain liking to some ideas, he is only interested in what works in real life. This Machiavellian approach to problems reminds me of one of Charlie Munger\u0026rsquo;s lessons in life: avoid extremely intense ideology.\nExtreme ideologies are really appealing to young people like us. I don\u0026rsquo;t exactly know why but my guess is that most young people are trying to find a place in the world for themselves. Ideologies help many people mentally work out their place in the world, how they can work towards something meaningful, and most importantly, how they can be a part of something bigger than themselves.\nI know this is a funny thing to say, but public version of Lee Kuan Yew is someone I aspire to be.\nAside from his political side, I like how he navigates around life. Mr Lee appears to be one of the few affluent politicians with a wide range of personality. He is known to have said controversial things, written controversial essays, and held many politically incorect opinions. I can see him as the Jordan Peterson of politics. He is not afraid of public opinion.\nPeople see him in different ways but I believe that\u0026rsquo;s how he wants to be seen. He probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t like being a likable figure throughout his lifetime and then have somebody put words in his mouth posthumously for some political gains.\nThe most interesting thing is, he has his ways with words. I don\u0026rsquo;t doubt for a second the complexity of his ideas but he always manages to communicate them effectively. Who knows, maybe his clarity of ideas is the reason for his government\u0026rsquo;s competence. When everybody is required to say what they mean and do what they say, that could help clear the logistics up a little bit.\nWhat a life he lived!\n","permalink":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/post/funny-thing/","summary":"I found myself thinking about what Lee Kuan Yew had to say about many things a lot recently.

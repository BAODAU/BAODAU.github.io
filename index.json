De Gaulle understood that self-awareness was key to his vcharisma: he retained an Olympian composure that played beautifully agaistn the hysteria of his colleageues. when he spoke, noone bould their eyes off him. flamboyancy has nothing to do with charisma: once you know how to command attention, heigten the effect by appearing in ceremonial and reitual events that are full of exciting imagery  unihibitedness  most people are repressed and have little access to their unconscious: a problem that creats opportunities for the Charismatic. You will first have to show that you are less inhibited that your audeince: that you radiate a dangerous sexuality, have no fear of death, and delightfully spontaneous an extension of your being unihibited is a dreamlike quality in your works the repressed are rigid, their cousins is a fluidisty of body and spirit.  fervency  you need to believe in something, and to believe in it strongly enough for it to animate all yor gestures and make your eyes light up. a prerequisite for fiery belief is some great cause to rally around: a crusade. become the rallying point for people\u0026rsquo;s discontent. and show that your share non of the doubts that plague normal humans. people are more and more isolated, and we long for communcal experience. let your own fervent and contagious faith, in virtually anything, give them something to believe in.  vulnerability  displays a need for love and affection. we re open to their audience, and in fact feed off its energy. the audience in turn is electrified by the Charismatic. since charisma involves feelings akin to love, you must reveal your love for your followers. if the audience does not sense this quality in you they will turn away from you. you must never seem manipulative or needy. nothing is more seductive to people tan the feeling that they are desired.  adventurousness  unconventional. they have an air of adventure and risk that attracts the bored. be brazen and courageous in your actions. be seen taking risks for the good of others. Charismatics thrive in troubled waters. show heroism to give yourself a charism that will last you a lifetime. the slightest sign of cowardice or intimidity will ruin whatever charisma you had.  magnestism  the eyes are the most physical attribute to seduction. they reveal excitement, tension, detachment, without a word being spoken. indirect communication is critical in seduction, and also in charisma. the demeanor of charismatics maybe posed and calm, but their eyes are magnetic. they have a piercing gaze that disturbs their targets' emotions, exerting force without words or action. all of these skills are acquirable. the look does not necessarily have to be aggressive. it can also show contenetment. your eyes can emanate charisma, but they can also give you away as a faker.  the savior  Lenin alone was followed unhesistatingly as the only indisputable leader. he was a man of iron will and inmitable energy who combines fanatical faith the movement, the cause, with no less faith in himself. at a time when other politicians were scrambling deperately to adapt to the national crisis, Lenin was rock stable  the deliverer  the deliverer provides an opportunity for the release of bottled-up emotions from other people: of the hostility masked by forced politeness and smiles. dilvererers have to be one of the suffering crowd, only more so. their pain must be exemplary. the dliverer must be a living example of personal redemption.   charismatic types  joan of arc: peasant french girl who had a vision so vivid, so detailled that she could convice the king to go to war with England. they lost but see, she was a good hustler. rasputin: the authentic animal  charisma what to learn form these people  describe these things in great detail, with an air of authority, and suddenly you stand out. if your prophecy is what people want to hear, they are lilely to fall under your spell. you will create a self-fulfilling prophecy: people\u0026rsquo;s belief in you will translate into actions that help realize your visions. people are more complicated than the masks they wear in society. the man who seems so noble and gentle is probably disguising a dark side, which will often come out in strange ways. on the ohter hand, we are drawn to people who seem more comforably human, who do not bother to disguise their contradictions. a man so authentically himself, so devoid of self-conscriousness or hypocrisy, is immensely appealing. his wickedness and saintliness were so extreme that it made him seem larger than life. the essence of charisma is an overpwering emotion that comunicates itself in your gestures, in your tone of bvoice, insubtle signs that are the more powerful for being unspoken. express what others are afraid to say and they will see great power in you. say what they want to say but cannot. never be afraid of goin too far.  the olympian actor  when using it is best to radiate calmness and control. to use dramatic effects sparingly double the effectiveness of the brief moents when you raise your voice or let loose a biting joke. all this must be carefully orchestrated. the  repressed  most of us are a mix of the devil and the saint, the noble and the ignoble. and we spend our lives trying to repress the dark side. few of us can give free rein to both sides. but we can create charisma to a smaller degree by riding ourselves of self-consciousness. anything extraordinary will create charisma. a crowd or group of any sort has a unique energy. just below the surface is desire, a constant sexual excutement has to be repressed because it is socially unacceptable. your uninhibitedness will invite other people to open up, sparking a chain reaction: their excitement will in turn animate you still more.  THE STAR  mythic star  People are divided by all kinds of consciously recognized categories: race, gender, class, religion, politics. It is impossible, then, to gain power on a grand scale, or to win an election, by drawing on conscious awareness; an appeal to any one group will only alienate another. Unconsciously, however, there is much we share. All of us are mortal, all of us know fear, all of us have been stamped with the imprint of parent figures; and nothing cojues up this shared experience more than myth.\n  your words and actions should invite interpretation beyond their surface appearance. you should seem to be dealing with matters of life and death, love and hate, authority and chaos.  keys to the character  form of persuasion that seeks to bypass consciousness, stirring the unconscious mind instead. we are so surrounded by stimuli that compete for our attention, bombarding us with obvious messages. we have grown increasingly cynical. learn the art of insinuation: reaching the unconscious. d  ","permalink":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/learn/seduction/","summary":"Charismatic what is it?  has little to do with an exciting physical appearance of colorful personality: qualities that elicit short-term interst. clear vision, a quality of single-mindedness, and practical skills can be devastatingly charsmatic, provided it is matched with some success. it is an illusion in they eyes of those who see you as having what they lack. this is the guru effect. the aura you are after is not the fiery one of most charismatics.","title":"Seduction"},{"content":"What am I addicted to  Hearthstone: Game Tiktok: social media Pornhub: porn feeling insecure   ","permalink":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/addiction/","summary":"What am I addicted to  Hearthstone: Game Tiktok: social media Pornhub: porn feeling insecure   ","title":"Addiction"},{"content":" Those great sweeps ofsnow that stop suddenly six feet from the house . . .

automatically, usually something salient to your survival, with evolutionary origins.\n  if we have a filter for\n  attention overload as a serious problem\n  we\u0026rsquo;re expected to do shadow work - the work of the companies for them.\n     have you ever sat in an airplan or train, just staring out the window with nothing to read, looking at nothing in particular? you might have found that time passed pleasantly.\n  you might have had a smilar feeling the last time you sat by the ocean or a lake, leeting your mind wander, and experiencing the relaxing feeling it induced. in this state, thoughts move seamlessly from one to another, there\u0026rsquo;s a merging of ideas, visual images, and sounds, of past, present, and future. thoughts turn inward - loosely connected, stream-of-consciousness thoguhts so much like the nighttime dream state that we call them daydreams\n  ths special brain state is marked by the flow of connections among disparate ideas and thoguhts, and a relative lack of barriers between sense and concepts. this network exerts a pull on consciousnessl it eagerly shifts the brain into mind wandering when\n  its discovery - a special brain network that supports a more fluid and nonlinear mode of thinking\n  it has taken over when you find you\u0026rsquo;ve been reading several pages in a book without registering their content, or when you are driving on a long stretch of highway and suddenly realize you havent' been paying attention to where you are and you missed your exit.\n  if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever stopped what you were doing to picture the conseunce of some future action or to imagine yourself in a particular future encounter, maybe your eyes turned up or down in your head from a normal straight-ahead gaze, and you became preoccupied with thought.\n  this is the default mode. this mode is a resting brain state, when your brain is not evnaged in a purposeful task. it\u0026rsquo;s not just that you can\u0026rsquo;t hold on to any one thought from the rolling stream, it\u0026rsquo;s that no single thought is demanding a response.\n  when you\u0026rsquo;re intensely focused on a task such as doing your taxes.\n  there are two brain states form a kind of yin-yang: when one is active, the other is not. during demanding tasks, the central executive kicks in,.\n  the phrase paying attention is a well-worn figurative language. atention has a cost. in a zero-sum game. we pay attention to one thing, either through conscious decision or because our attentional filter deemed it important enough to push it to the forefront of attentional focus.\n  people have focused on mapping the parts of the brain with different activities: tennis, music, perform mathematical calcualtions.\n  language ability does not reside in a specific region of the brain; it comprises a distributed network. the mind-wandering mode works in opposition to the central executive mode: when one is activated, the other is deactivated.\n  in our mind-wandering mode, our thoughts are mostly directed inward to our goals, desires, feelings, plans, and also our relationship with other people. there is a clear evolutionary advantage to beinbg able to stay on task and concentrate, we can switch\n  the orbital and prefrontal areas are responsible for things like planning, scheduling, and impulse control, and the supplementary motor area is responsible for initiating movement.\n  the inner dialuge is generated by the planning centers of your brain in the prefontal cortex, and the questions are being answered by other parts of your brain that possess the info\n  consciousness is a continuum of different states. the more accurate neural descriptions is that many networks of neurons are firing, much like the network of telephones simultaneously ringing in a busy office.\n  if you\u0026rsquo;re driving along and your thoguhts start to wander, this is the system that snaps to when a large truck suddenly crosses over into your lane, and gives you a shot of adrenaline at the same time.\n  ADHD drugs can block noreadrenaline release, and in turn block your alerting to warning signals\n  if you\u0026rsquo;re a sonar operator in asubmarine, you want your alerting system to be function at full capacity.\n  where memory comes from   parts of the brain can fall asleep for a few moments or longer without our realizing it. at any given moment,\n  many things get lost when we are not attending to the moment putting them down. to train ourselves to a zen-like focus living in the moment, of paying attention to whenever we put things down or put things away.\n  theory: many memories we\u0026rsquo;ve experienced are in there.\n memory is unreliable because the untrained brain has a crappy filling system. it takes everything that happens to you and throws it all willy-nilly into a big dark cloest.\n  when we experience any event, a nuique network of neurosn is activated depending on the nature of the event. neurons fire for face recognition for the players , motion detection for the movements of their bodies the act of remembering something is a process of bringing back on line those neurons that ere involved in the original experience. once we get those neurons to become active in a fashion similar to how thery were dying the original event, we experience the memory as lower-resolution replay of the original event. the remembering is imperfect: the instructions for which neurons need to be gathered and how exactly they need to fire are weak and degraded, leading to a simulacrum of the real experience.    thus our memory tends to be poor most of the time, not because the limited capacity of our brains to store the info but because of the nature moemory retrieval,\n  the biggest problem in humanity is that we dont know when were recalling things inaccurately. of often have a strong feeling of certainty that accompanies an incorrect, distorted memory. the more we can externalize memory throught physical records outthereintheworld, the less we must rely on our overvonfident, underprecise memoryu.\n  the best remembered- experiences are disinctive/unique or have a strong emotional component.\n  the reason why it is difficult to remember what you ate for breakfast two thursdays ago is that there is nothing special about that breakfast.\n  memory retrieval requires our brains to sift throught mutlille, competing instances to pick out just the ones we are trying to recollect.\n  having breakfast served to you in bed on your twenty-first birthday by a new, naked, romantic partner is even more unusual.\n  we need to remember unique or disintivive events because theyu represnet a potential change in the world around us or our undretstanding of it.\n  if something made us incredibly frightrend, elated, sad, or angry: we are more likely to remember it.\n  fuzzy categories are instantiated biologically in the brain, being able to create, use, and understand both kinds of categoes is something that our brains are hardwired to do.\n  people at the top of their professions, in particular those known for their creativity and effectiveness, use system of atttention and memory external to their brain as much as they can. a lot of the muse low tech solution for keeping on top of things..\n  when alen made a big list of

endogenous opioids little decisions take up as much energy as big ones. one of the first things we lose is impulse control. after making lots of insignificant decisions, we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important we are sacrificing efficiency and deep concentration when we interrupt our priority activities with email. we feel a sense of accomplishment after doing small

you make it a point to sort them regularly .\n  the names of categories arent imporant. its the pricess f external categorization.\n  if you can attend to one of the things on your list in less than two minutes do it now. if a task can be done by someone else. delegate it. anything that takes more than two mintes, defer.\n  you can keep these things all in your brain. but not effective.\n  people who use the index card system find it liberating.\n  some of the best ideas you\u0026rsquo;ll have come tin when youre doing something unrelated. you dont need to carry all the cards with you

our homes affordances  simple affordances for the objects of our lives can rapidly ease the mental burden of trying to keep track of where they are. whenever you are home, that is where they keys

as transactive memory, that includes the knowledge of who in your social network possesses the knowledge you seek.\n  a large part of organizing our social world successfully is identifying what we want from it. most of us want to feel that we fit in somewhere and art part of a group.\n  being alone for too long causes neurochemical changes that can result in hallucinations, depression, suicidal thoughts, violent behaviors, and even psychosis.\n  social isolation is also a risk factor for cardiac arrest and death.\n  although many of us think we prefer being alone, we dont know what we want.\n  there is comfort in belonging\n  our brains carry around a vestigial primordial longing to know where all these people in our lives ended up\n  we dont keep up with people whom we dont like or whose relevance to our lives diminish over time.\n  theres an illusion in all of this. social networking provides breadth but no depth. the online interaction works best as a supplement, not a replacement for inperson contact.\n  women are more focused than men on commitment and continuity of communication.\n  men on sexual and physical closeness\n  intimacy, love, and passion dont always go together - they belong to different multidimensional constructs\n  we have an innate tendency to deceive when it is in our own self-interest.\n  intimacy is a new thing. many of us ask more than ever of our romantic partners. we expect them to be there for emotional support, companionship, intimacy, and financil support, and we expect at various times they will function as confidante, nurse, sounding board, secretary, treasurer, parent, protector, guide, cheerleader, masseuse, and throught it all we expect them to be consistently alluring, sexully appealing, and to stay in lockstep with our own sexual appetites and preferences. we expect our partners to help us achive our full potential in life.\n  our increased desire for our partners to do all these things is rooted in a biological need to conenct deeply with at least one other person. when it is missing, making such a connection becomes a high priority. when that need is fulfilled by a satisfying intimate relationship, the benefits are both psychological and physiiological. people in a relationship experience better health, recover from illnesses more quickly, and live longer.\n  the presence of a satisfying intimate relationship is one of the strongest predictors of happiness and emotional well-being that has ever been measured. how do we enter into and maintain intimate relationships.\n  to be agreeable is to be cooperative, friendly, considerate, and helpful - attributes that are more or less stable across the lifetime, and show up early in childhood. we can control undesirable emotions such as anger and frustration.\n  children who receive positive reinforcement for impulse control and anger management become agreeable adults. being an aggreable person is a tremendous advantage for maintaing positive social relationships.\n   having a best friend during adolescence is an important part of becoming a well-adjusted adult. those without one are more likely to be bullied and marginalized and to carry these experiences into becoming a disagreeable adults.    having an aggreeable friend also protects social problems later in life.\n  on average, marriage partners tend to be similar in age, education level, and attractiveness.\n  the internet has helped some of us to become more social and to establish and maintain a larger number of relationships. for others, particularly heavy internet users who are introverted to begin with, the internet has led them to become less socially involved, lonelier, and more likely to become depressed. theres is a dramatic decline in empathy among college students. who apparently are far less likely to say that it is valuable to put oneself in the place of others or to try and understand their feelings. its because were spending more time alone under the illusion that theyr being social.\n  this streamlined access to a pool of thoudsands of potential partners can elicit an evaluative, assessment-oriented mindset that leads online daters to objectify potential partners and might even undermine their willingness to commit to one of them.\n  it can also cause people to make lazy, ill-advised deciosn due to cognitive and decision overload. consumers cant keep track of more than two or three variables of interest when evaluating a large number of alternatives. this is directly related to the capacity limitations of working memory.\n  its also related limitations of our attentional network. when considering dating alternatives, we need to get our minds to shuttle back and forth between the central executive mode: keeping track of all those little details, and the daydreaming mode: what our life would be like with them in our life, the mode in which we try to picture oursevles with each of the attractive alternatives.\n  that rapid switching between central executive calculating and dreamy mind0wandering depletes neural resources, leading us to make poor decisions. when cognitive resources are low, we have difficulty focusing on relevant information and ignoring the irrelevant.\n  staying in any commited monogamous relationship requires fidelity, or forgoing the forbidden fruit. this is known to be a function of the availability of attractive alternatives. stories of people who forgot to take their dating profile down after meeting and beginning a serious relationship with someone are legion.\n  online daters engage in deception.\n  once we are in a relationship, romantic or platonic, how well do know the people we care about. and how good are we at knowing their thoughts?\n  people lie for reasons: fear of reprisal, avoiding hurting other people\u0026rsquo;s feelings, whitelies to minimize antogonism. we are good at telling when people are lying and we go along with it.\n  a large part of social interaction requires that we subdue our innate primate hostilities in order to get along. one way of helping to keep learge numbers of humans living close proximity is through the use of nonconfrontational speech, or indirect speech acts. indirect speech acts dont say what we actually want, but they imply it. they are called implicatures\n  indirect speech acts are a powerful social glue that enables us to get along. the act of uttering an idirect speech act can be seen as inherently an act of play, an invitation to cooperate in a game of verbal hide-and-seek \u0026lsquo;do you understand what im saying?\u0026rsquo; they invoke in both the speaker and the hearer a shared representation of the world; they rely on shared background info that is both linguistic and social. by appealing to their shared knowledge, the speaker and listener are creating a pact and affirming their shared worldview.\n  social rejection causes activation in the same part of the brain as physical pain does. tylenol can reduce people\u0026rsquo;s experience of social pain.\n  the set of utterances that can so change the state of the world is limited, but they are powerful. we empower these legal or quasi-legal authorities in order to facilitate our understanding of the social world.\n  theres a hormone in the brain released by the back half of the pituitary gland, oxytocin. when a person has an orgasm, oxytocin is released, and of the effects of oxytocin is to make us feel bonded to others.\n  nature\u0026rsquo;s way of causing couples to want to stay together after sex to raise any children that might result from that sex. it is clearly an evolutionary advantage for a child to have two caring, nurturing parents. if the parents feel bonded to each other through oxytocin release, they are more likely to share in the raising of their children, thus propagating their tribe\n  oxytocin in idividuls with autism shows up at lower than normal levels, and the administration of oxytocin causes them to become more social, and improves emotion recognition.\n  oxytocin creates a feeling of trust\n  people who receive social support during illness recover more fully and more quickly.\n  levels of oxytocin also increase during gaps in social support or poor social functioning.\n  oxytocin regulates the salience of social information and is capable of eliciting positive and negative social emotions. its role is to organize social behavior.\n  nondrug therapies, such as music, may exert similar therapeutic effects via oxytocinergic regulation. music has been shown to increase oxytocin levels, esp when people listen to or play music together.\n  a related chemical in the brain, a protein called arginine vasopressin, regulate affiliation, sociability, and courtship.\n  vasopressin causes some murine species to behave \u0026lsquo;polygamously\u0026rsquo;\n  active ingredient marijuana activates cannabinoid receptors, which increases social activity\n  LSD stimulate dopamine and certain serotonine receptors\n  in order to feel socially connected to others, we like to think we know them, and to some extent we can predict their behavior.\n    we have a tendency to describe the people we know in trait terms: theyre extroverts or introverts, agreeable or not, the life of the party or stickinthemud in social psychology experiments. funcdamental attribution error: an additional part of the fundamental attribution error is that we fail to appreciate the roles people are forced to play in certain situations constrain their behavior. suppose youre walking down the halls of your office and pass a new coworker. you say hello and he doesnt respond. you could atribute his bahavior to a stable personality trait nd conclude that he is shy or that he is rude. or you could attribute his bahavior to a situational factor. the more cognitive load one is experiencing, the more likely one is to make errors in judgement about the causes of an individual\u0026rsquo;s bahavior.  on the edge of your social world  we tend to have a very difficult time ignoring info that has been shown later to be false. humans gossip for many reasons: it helps us feel suoerior to others when we otherwise feel insecure about ourselves. if tiffany is willing to join in the gossip with me against britney. humans tend to be innately suspicious of outsiders where and outsider is anyone different from us: religion, skin color, hometowm, the school from which we graduated, our income level, the political party we belong to, the kinds of music we listen to, highschoolers typically break into dozens of subcliques based on further partitioning of what constitutes people like us. this partitioning arises at a time when our brains and bodies are undergoing dramatic neural and hormonal changes. we tend to oversestimate the similarities of outgroup members a group will be perceived differently, and more accurately, by its own members than by outsiders ingroup and outgroup effects have a neurobiological basis. within an area of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex, theres a group of neurons that fire when we think about ourselves and poeple who are like us. due to exposure. were better able to engage the medial prefrontal cortex with ingroup members because their bahaviors are easier for our brains to visualize in all their nuance. it appears that the partitioning of people into mutually exclusive categories activates the perception that \u0026lsquo;we\u0026rsquo; are better than \u0026lsquo;they\u0026rsquo; even when there is no rational basis for it. thats just the way \u0026lsquo;we\u0026rsquo; are when we think about organizing our social world, the implication of ingroup/outgroup bias is clear. we have a stubborn tendency to misjudge outsiders and diminish our abilities to forge new, cooperative, and potentially valuable social relations. racism is a form of negative social judgement that arises from a combination of belief perseverance, outgroup bias, categorization error, and faulty inductive reasoning. in case of ingroup/outgroup bias, each group thinks of the other as homogeneous and monoithic, and each group views itself as variegated and complex the act of living in cities and towns together is an act of cooperation. various levels of gov pass laws to define civil behavior. we rely on each other not just to observe the law but to be basically helpful and cooperative beyond the law. social interactions are complex and a number of experiments have demonstrated that we tend either to act in our own self interest or just plain dont want to get involved. the tendency to not get involved is driven by three powerful, interrelated psychological principles.   strong desire to confrom to others' behavior in the hope that it will allow us to gain acceptance within our social group. to be seen as cooperative and agreeable. social comparison: we tend to examine our bahavior in terms of others diffusion of responsibility. natural and ingrained feelings about equity and wanting to punish freeloaders.   we are nost just a social species but often a selfish one. what is the neurochemical mechanism that supports this altruistic sentinel behavior. oxytocin - the same social affilitive hormone that increases trust and social cooperation among humans. try to be agreeable.  organizing our time   prefrontal cortex. more highly developed than other species. seed of many behaviors we consider distinctly human: logic, analysis, problem solving, good judgement, planning for the future, decision making.\n  CEO of the brain. extensive two-way connections between the prefrontal cortex and almost every other region of the brain place it in a unique position to schedule, monitor, manage, and manipulate nearly every activity we undertake.\n  one of the great achievements of the human prefrontal cortex is that it provides us with impulse control and the ability to delay gratification, something that most animals lack. children and adolescents are not good at planning or delaying gratification\n  dysexecutive syndrome: planning and time coordination deficits. utter lack of inhibition across a range behaviors, particularly in social settings. blurt out inappropriate remarks, go on binges.\n  if your inhibitions are reduced, youre impaired at seeing the future consequences of your actions. you tend to do\n  damage to the prefrontal cortex causes an inability to effectively go forward or backward in time in one\u0026rsquo;s mind. we get stuck in the present, doing something over and over again, perseverating, revealing a failure in temporal control.\n  they can be terrible at organizing their calendars and todo lists due to a double whammy of neural deficits. first, theyre unable to place events in the correct temporal order.\n  if you dont know you have it. youre liabke to go headlong into situations without taking proper precautions and end up in trouble.\n  advanced prefrontal cortex damage interferes\n  with the ability to make connections and associations between disparate thoguhts and concepts, resulting in a loss of creativity. esp important for generating creative acts in art and music. this is the region of the brain that is most active when creative artists are functioning at their peak.\n  most of us live in a goldilocks zone where everything is just right. thats when weplan our activities, follow through on our plans, and inhibit impulses that would take us off track.\n  the brain coordinates a large share of the body\u0026rsquo;s housekeeping and timekeeping functions - regulating heart rate and blood pressure, signaling whent its time to sleep and wake up, letting us know when were hungry or full, and maintaining body temperature even as the outside temperature changes.\n  higher cognitive functions of the brain handled by the cerebral cortex: reasoning, problem solving, language, music, precision athletic movement, mathematical ability, art, and the mental operations that support them: meory attention, perception, motor palnning, and categorization.\n  n=1 experiment playing music to an owl: neural firing pattern the same pattern of beats and ptiches that were in the original music\n  this includes relatively well-known neurochemicals: serotonin, dopamin, oxytocin, epinephrine, as well as acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, and endocannabinoids. chemicals are released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of info in the brain.\n  manufacturing these chicals, and dispersing them to regulate and modulte brain activity, requires energy: they get that energy from glucose. no other tissue in the body relies solely on glucose for energy except the testes.\n  eating or drinking glucose. chronic ingestion of sugars. can damage other systems and lead to diabetes and sugar crash.\n  the brain burns glucose as a car burns gasoline, fuel to mental operations.\n  most brain energy is used in synptic transmission in conneting neurons to one another and in turn connecting thoughts and ideas to one another.\n  the brain only takes in the world little bits and chunks at a time.\n  the brain picks and chooses and acticipates what it thinks is goin to be important, what you should pay attention to.\n  people who organize their time in a way that allows them to focus are going to get more done, less tired and less neurochemically depeted after doing it. daydreaming takes less energy than multitasking. multitasking by definition disrupts the kind of sustain thought needed for problem sovling and for creativity.\n  multitasking is bad for innovation. brain\u0026rsquo;s arousal system has a novelty bias, meaning that its attention can be hijacked easily by something new: humans will work as hard to obtain a novel experience as we will to get a meal or a mate.\n  the very brain region we need to rely on for stayin on task is easily distracted by shiny new objects.\n  in multitasking, we unknowingly enter anaddiction loopp as the brain\u0026rsquo;s novelty centers become rewarded for processing shiny new stimuli, to the detriment of our prefrontal cortex, which wants to stay on task and gain the rewards of sustained effort and attention.\n  trdeoff in multitasking comes down to focus vs creativity.\n  we consider a discovery to be creative if it explores new ideas through analogy, metaphor, or tying together things that we didnt realize were connected.\n  individuals who take dopamine-enhancing drugs such as methylphenidate report that it helps them to stay motivated to work, to stay focused, and to avoid distractions.\n  interesting gene: COMT. appears to modulate the ease with which people can switch tasks, by regulating the amount of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.\n  low dopamines in the prefrontal cortex: greater cognitive flexibility, easier task switching, more creativity than average.\n  high dopamne levels:less cognitive flexibility, difficulty task switching. many people who have ADD are more creative and that those who can stay very focused on task might be excelennt workers when following instructions but are not esp. creative.\n  prefrontal cortex damage: can lead to deficits both in event segmentation.\n  when we do complex tasks. our prefrontal cortex works with our hippocamus to build an ensemble of mental images of the finished outcome alongside mental mimages of the partly finished outcomes. also subconsciously picture what would happen if we did things out of order.\n  chunk  if i have something big i want to get done, break it into chunks: meaningful, implementable, doable chunks. theres the balance between doing and monitoring your progress. we work, we inspect the wor, we make adjustments, we push forward. the prefrontal cortex coordinates the compariosn of whats out there and whats in our head. we must constantly go back and forth between work and evaluation, comparing the ideal image in our head with the owkr in front of us. many many phd students fall into this categoru. never finishing their degrees because they cant move forward. planning and doing require separate parts of the brain. to be both a boss and a worker, one needs to form and maintain multiple ordered attentional sets and then bounce back and forth between them. it forms an executive attentional set for a task and then constructs a worker attentional set for doing the actual task the exec set cares only that the job is done and well. the worker gets down to we the mop and start the job. a good worker will be able to call uopn a level of attention subordinate to all that and momentarily become a kind of detail-oriented worker. if we dont plan, we might have to make high level decisions. all this level shifting, exec to worker, is a shifting of the attentional set and it comes with the metabolic cost of multitasking. by dividing up the roles in, workers dont have to gaf.  worker mode.  if you have chores to do, put similar chores together if clean house, just clean house. stay focused and maintain a single attentional set through to completion of a job. organizing our mental resources efficiently means providing slots in our schedules. allows us to get more done and finish up with more energy,  sleep  bimodal sleep: 2 rounds of sleep. first round of sleep occur 4 or 5 hours after dinner. followed by an awake period of one or more hours in the middle of the night. followed by a second period of four or five hours of sleep. bimodal sleep nap regime is healthier and promotes greater life satisfaction efficiency and performance. caffeine enhances cognitive function. but it only works best when ypu\u0026rsquo;ve bee

still wake up at a fixed time in the next morning. sleep in a cool, dark room. cover your windows if needed to keep out light.  naps  naps: beautiful, scrumptious, very much needed for worn-out neural circuits. naps longer than 40 mins are counterproductive. dont naps after hitting the snooze button or close to actual sleep time powernaps yield significant cognitive enhancement, improvement in memory, and increased productivity.  procrastinate  do the most unpleasant task the first thing in the morning to get it out of the way. willpower deplets as the day moves on. procrastination is a failure of self-regulation, planning, impulse control, or a combination of all 3. the tendency to procrastinate has been found to be correlated with certain traits, lifestyles, and other factors. younger and single are more likely to procrastinate. being outside in natural settings: parks, forests, the beach, the mountains, and the desert. replenished self-regulatory mechanisms in the brain. living or spending time in nature as opposed to urban environments reduce the tendency to procrastinate selective migration: large urban centers are associated with critical thinking and and creativity, and also procrastination. the increased bombardment of sensory info reduces the ability to enter the daydreaming mode, the mode that replenished the exec attention system. is there a brain region implicated in procrasination. procrastination resembles some of the temporal planning deficits we saw following prefrontal damage.  types  some of us procrastinate difficult or unpleasant tasks in favor of those that are more fun. others pursue unpleasant task in favor of those that are more fun or that yield an immediate reward.   the rest seeking procrastinators would generally rather not be exerting themselves at all. while the fun-task procrastinators enjoy being busy and active all the time. delayed gratification: activities with a long time to completion (long time to reward) are the ones more likely to be started late. and those with an immediate reward are less likely to be procrastinated humans have a low tolerance for frustration. when choosing what tasks to undertake or activities to pursue, we tend to choose not the most rewarding but the easisest. this means that unpleasant or difficult things get put off.   we tend to evaluate our self-worth in terms of our achievements. whether we lack self-confidence in general: or confidence that this particular project will turn out well. we procrastinate because that allows us to delay putting our reputations on the line until later.\n why?  our limbic system, and immediate-rewards-seeking parts of the brain contest with our prefrontal cortex. which all too well understands that consequenes of falling behind. both regions run on dopamine. but the dopamine has different actions in each. dopamine in the prefrontal cortex causes us to focus and stay on task. dopamine in the limbic system, along with the brain\u0026rsquo;s own endogenous opioids, causes us to feel pleasure. we put things off wehenver the desire for immediate pleasure wins out over our ability to delay gratification, depending on which dopamine system is in control some individuals suffer from initiaion deficits: cant start others fail to accomplish tasks on time because they cant finish maybe because of the lack of skills. maybe from perfectionism.  mindset  successful person sees each setback as an opportunity to gain additional knowlege to accomplish my goal success: \u0026lsquo;i thought i knew everything i needed to know to achieve my goals. but this has taught me that i dont. once i learn this, i can get back on track.\u0026rsquo; they expect a rocky life ahead. 2 subregions involved in self-assessment and judging own performance are dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the orbital cortex. self-confidence appears to have a genetic basis.   faulty beliefs  life should be easy our self-worth is dependent on our success if our self-confidence and the value of completing the task are both high, we\u0026rsquo;re less likely to procrastinate.  $$ \\textbf{procrastination } = \\frac{\\text{time to complete a task x distractability} }{\\text{self-confidence x task value}} $$\ncreativity  achieving insight across a wide variety of problems. first we focus all our attention on the aspects of the problem is it is presented (combing through different possible solutions and scenarios with our left prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate) second phase, we need to relax, let go of the problem, and let networks in the right hemisphere take over neurons in the right hemisphere are more broadly tuned, with longer branches and more dendritic spines. less precise but more connected. the moment preceding insight is accompanied by a burst of gamma waves. which bind together disparate neural networks, effectivelt binding thoughts that were seemingly unrelated into a coherent new whole.  maximize creativity  flow state: different state of being during flow, two key regions of the brai ndeactivate: the portion of the prefrontal cortex responsible for self-criticism, and the amygdala, the brain\u0026rsquo;s fear center.  flow state  attention is focused on a limited perceptual field, and that field receives your full concentration and complete investment action and awareness merge.you cease thinking about yourself as separate from the activity or the world, and you don\u0026rsquo;t think of your actions and your perceptions as being distinct: what you think becomes what you do. during flow, you experience freedom from worry about failure; you are aware of what needs to be done, but you don\u0026rsquo;t feel that you are doing it. the ego is not involved and falls away completely. flow is a lack of distractibility: the same old distractions are there, but we\u0026rsquo;re not tempted to attend to them. we monitor our performance without the kinds of self-defeating negative judgments flow states don\u0026rsquo;t occur for just any old task or activity. they can occur only when one is deply focused on the task, when the task requires intense concentration and commitment, provides immediate feedback, and is perfectly matched to one\u0026rsquo;s skill level if the task you are engaged in is too simple, holding no challenge, i\u0026rsquo;ll get bored. that boredom will break my attention to the task, and my mind will wander into the default mode. if the task is too difficult and holds too many challenges. i\u0026rsquo;ll become frustrated and experience anxiety. the greater my skill is, the greater the opportunity to achieve flow. the flow state is characterized by a total lack of conscious awareness, am erging of your self with the project itself, a seamless melding of thought, action, movment, and result. the higher your skill level, the more easily you can practive those skills automatically, subconsciously, and then the more easily you can disengage your conscioys mind, your ego, and other enemies of flow. easier for those who have invested a great deal of time to a given dopamin  what flow means  high level of engagement. info access and processing seem effortless. skills we didn\u0026rsquo;t know we had emerges. with no need to exercise self-control to stay focused, we free neural resources to the task at hand. during flow states, we no longer need to exert ourselves to stay on task: it happens automatically as we enter this specialized attentional state. it takes less energy to be in flow than to be distracted. this is why flow states are periods of great productivity and efficiency flow is a chemically different state. flow occurs when you are not explicitly thinking about what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. your brain is in a special mode of activity in which procedures and operations are performed automatically without your having to exert conscious control. trying to think about what you\u0026rsquo;re doing can quickly interferem ending the automaticity and high performance level you\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed.  flow can be disruptive  can become an addiction.  deep shit  when we think about our lives as a whole, we think whether we feel we made any contributions with our lives.   distractions  if you really need to get something done, give it to a busy person. a large part of efficient time management revolves around avoiding distractions an ironic part of life is that we are harmed by the things we desire the temptations that can disrupt our lives are pure indulgences. realizing when a diversion has gotten out of control is one of the great challenges of life. anything that tempts us to break the greatest life satisfaction comes from completing projects that require sustained focus and energy. to ignore distractions, we have to trick ourselves, or create system that helps us stick to the work two kinds of distractions we need to deal with are external and internal.  external  set aside a particular time of day to work. adopt the mental set that this thing you\u0026rsquo;re doing now is the most important thing you could be doing we have to rely on our own wits, and on the prefrontal cortex\u0026rsquo;s central executive. difficult tasks benefit from a sustainede period of concentration of fifty minutes or more, due to the amount of time it takes to settle into and maintain a focused state. best time-management technique is to ensure you have captured every single thing that has your attention, or should have your attention, by writing it down. then you can step back and look at your list from an observer standpoint and not let yourself be drivent by what\u0026rsquo;s the latest and loudest in your head. taking breaks is also important. getting up to walk around at least once every ninety minutes.  five-minute rule  things you can deal with now are better off being dealt with, rather than letting them accumulate. set aside a designated block of time to deal with all these little things.  calculate my time worth  do not spend more time on a decision than its worth.  organizing info for the hardest decisions  we\u0026rsquo;re faced with decisions every day that impact our livelihood, our happiness, and our health.  thinking straight about probabilities  cognitive science has taught us that relying on our gut or intuition often leads to bad decisions, esp. in cases where statistical info is avaialble part of maintaining an organized mind and orgnized life requires that we make the best decisions possible. bad decisions sap strength and energy.  categories of

As humans, one of our most important goals is mastery: the desire to become increasingly competent or effective at something.\n  being \u0026lsquo;superioir\u0026rsquo; gives us the autonomy or freedom to be who we are; higher-status individuals don\u0026rsquo;t feel the need to watch what they say or restric their behaviors. superiority is about the need for approval. it is about self-esteem. it is aboyt mastery. and about autonomy.  does being superior make me happier  yes. participants made to feel superior displayed more positive expressions, while those made to feel inferior displayed more negative ones. happy people are generally more successful. lower in status are more prone to falling sick, are sick for longer periods of time, have shorter life spans, and suffer more emotional negativity than those higher in status. those higher in status perceive themselves to have greater autonomy and control over their own decisions and this makes them happier it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to come up with objective yardsticks for assessone one\u0026rsquo;s standing relative to others in any domain. almost everyone believes they are better tan the average person on positive traits like professionalism, warmth, and kindness. the proxy yardsticks of  why materialism lowers happiness  the catch with earning more is that expenses catch up with earnings. we adapt to new levels of wealth, power, and fame means that we need to become increasingly wealthy, powerful, and famous over the course of our lives to maintain high levels of happiness. adaptation is a big reason why materialism diminishes happiness levels in the long run. promotes self-centeredness and lowers compassion, making others less likely to cooperate with materialistic people, leading them to be less happy in the long run. lower compassion leads us to compromise on things that actually bring joy and happiness - things like haning out with freinds and family or contributing to society. compared to nonmaterialistic people, materialistic people are more likely to suffer from mental disorders tethering one\u0026rsquo;s self-worth to being better than others can lead to obsessing about the implications of failing to achieve this goal, making one more vulnerable to depression. those with a high need for superiority may end up sacrificing long-term learning and growth for the sake of short term boosts in hubristic pride. the detrimental effect it has on the quality of relationships. those who pursue superiority tend to be takes and takers aren\u0026rsquo;t well liked. people are much more likely to cooperate with givers the less attention you pay to how much better or worse than others you are, the happier you are likely to be. the more you compare yourself with others, the less happy you will be.  mitigating the need for superiority  not only is the need for superiority hardwired in us, but most of us are also socialized to pursue it. being superior makes us happier, pursuing superiority lowers happiness mitigate the misconception about the need for superiority. many of us believe the need for superiority is an important determinant of success. this is mostly wrong. why??

In thoudsands of ways, oura parents gave us the message that they only approve a part of us  body taboos  BRO THIS IS MAD COOL   A friend of hers named Chris and her eleven-month-old son happened to drop by her house one day. Soon my friend and Chris and the baby were sitting out on the back deck, sipping ice tea. Since the May sunshine was pleasantly warm, Chris took off the baby’s clothes so he could sunbathe. The two women chatted while the little boy crawled around on the deck, happily digging his fingers into the warm soil of the flowerpots. After about half an hour, the baby became hungry, and Chris put him to her breast. My friend noticed that as the baby nursed he developed a miniature erection. Apparently nursing was such a sensual experience that he felt pleasure throughout his body. Instinctively, the little boy reached down to touch his genitals. Unlike most mothers, Chris did not pull his hand away. Her baby was allowed to feel the warm sun on his naked skin, nurse from his mother’s breasts, have an erection, and add to his pleasure by holding on to his penis.\n  it is normal and naturla for an infant to want to have good feelings, but we rearly allow it. When we were young, there were many, many times when limits were placed on our sensuality.  forbidden feelings  our emotions were another prime candidate for socialization. parents encouraged sociable behaviors like laughter and discouraged it is rare for parents to validate a child\u0026rsquo;s anger. if i react to my daughter\u0026rsquo;s anger with something like:  \u0026ldquo;I can see that you\u0026rsquo;re mad. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to do whatI ask. but i am the parent and you are the child and you need to do what i say.\u0026rdquo;\n  having her anger acknowledged would contribute to her sense of self.  tools of repression  conditioned by our parents to be aware of acceptable behaviors. we come to the conclusion that some thoughts and feelings are so unacceptable that they should be eliminated, so we construct an imaginary parent in our head to police our thoughts and activities, a part of the mind that psychologists call the \u0026lsquo;superego\u0026rsquo; whenever a child has a forbidden thought or indulges in an \u0026lsquo;unacceptable\u0026rsquo; behavior, he expereinces a self-administered jolt of anxiety. this is so unpleasant that the child puts to sleep some of those forbidden parts of himself. he represses them. the ultimate price of his obedience is a loss of wholeness  the false sense  we create a \u0026lsquo;false self\u0026rsquo; a character structue that serves a double purpose: it camouflages those parts of his being that he has repressed and protects him from further injury. when he gets into a love relationship, he will criticize his partner for her desire for intimacy and her intact sexuality.  we adopt negative traits from our parents  why don\u0026rsquo;t people simply tell each other in plain English that they want more affection or attention or lovemaking or freedom or whatever when we were young, we were taught that the only way to get what we want is to provoke people around us this primitive method of signaling distress is characteristic of most couples immersed in a power struggle even though their partners react to these maneuvers with renewed hostility, they  stages of the power struggle   it followws a predictable course, one that happens to parallel the well-documented stages of grief in a dying or bereaved person.\n  first comes the shock, that horrifying moment of truth w find a way tohen a window opens and a wrenching thought invades your consciousness: this is not the person I thought I had married.\n  at that instant you assume that married life is going to be a continuation of the loneliness and pain of childhood.\n  after shock comes denial.\n  after that you feel betrayed. you are in pain, and the degree of your pain is the degree of the disparity between your earlier fantasy of your partner and your partner\u0026rsquo;s emerging reality.\n  fourth stage: bargaining. this stage goes like this: if you will give up your drinking, i will be more interested in sex.\n  last stage is despair. no hope. 5% find a way to resolve the power struggle.\n  we enter relationships with the unconscious assumption that our partner will become a surrogate parent and make up for all the deprivation of our childhool. all we have to do to be healed is to form a close, lasting relationship\n  the partner is perceived as witholding love. we begin to hurt each other, or deny each other pleasure and intimacy, in hopes of having their partners respond with warmth and love.\n  becoming conscious  Seldom or never does a marriage develop into an individual relationship smoothly without crisis. There is no birth of consciousness without pain. C.G.Jung\n reromanticizing  through daily repetitions of psitive behaviors, your old brain begins to perceive your partner as \u0026lsquo;someone who nurtures me.\u0026rsquo; your old brain associates your partner as a wellspring of life. this opens ways for intimacy, which is only possible in a context of pleasure and safety it helps people erode the infantile belief that their partners can read their minds. when they fail to satisfy their secret desires, they assume that they are deliberately depriving them of pleasure. most relationships are run like a commodities market, with loving behaviors the coin in trade. this comes straight out of the hood: our childhood. when we were infants, love came without price tags. we want to be loved and cared for without having to do anything in return. when our partners grant us caring behaviors independent of our actions, our need for unconditional love appears to be satisfied. often, partners in a relationship cater to their own needs and preferences.  do unto others as they would have you do unto them random reinforcement  a pleasurable action loses its effectiveness if it\u0026rsquo;s repeated with predictable regularity. gifts are so customary that they are almost taken for granted  ","permalink":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/relationship/getting-love/","summary":"we all started out life whole and vital.

remedied by being more conscious of our interactions  the message it sends  i dont care about your bid i want to avoid your bid im not interested in your interests ive got more important things on my mind im too busy to pay attention to your bid your bid is not worth my time i want to be more independent than you want me to be  how do people respond to that bid   most people feel hurt. they may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation, and rejection. theres a little kid inside all of us that feels that way when our bids are ignored or dismissed\n  a person may feel so distressed that he becomes hypervigilant or oversensitive to insult\n  when somebody turns away from a bid, the bidder loses confidence and self-esteem\n  they dont get puffed up with anger; they dont get indignant; they just seem to fold in on themselves. they feel defeated. they give up.\n  feeling discouraged once their bids for connection have been rejected or ignored, people rearely re-bid. even in satisfied relationships, couples dont even rebid. if this hopeless attitude becomes dominant, theres less bidding, less opportunity for connection\n  habitually turning away can eventually destroy relationships.\n  dismissed bidder typically gets fed up. forming a pattern of attack and defend.\n  adults in the family dont mean to neglect their kids or cause them harm but theyre so consumed by their own problems that every interaction with their kids amounts to telling them to be quiet or go away.\n  start paying more attention to the details of her boys' lives: make a concertaed daily effort to offer them praise for the things they were doing right, and to ask them about their activities in a way that showed she was really listening\n  the more people turn away from one anotherm the more conflict they\u0026rsquo;ll have to contend with later on. the more they turn toward one another\u0026rsquo;s bids, the less contentios their relationships will be\n  you can\u0026rsquo;t make a habit of turning away and expect the relationship to survive\n   turn against bids for connection  theses responses make the bidder feel hurt and rejected if the respondent holds a psition of power over the bidder, the bidder may even become anxious or afraid, which leades to suprressing feelings and avoiding conflict. its not unusual for people to remain in such suppressed, conflict-avoiding relationships for a long time at some point, bidders stop the biddiding and partners dirft apart. even when they stay in the relationship, they may quit interacting with each other altogether  contemptuous reponses  entail hurtful, disrespecting comments aimed at the person bidding for connection. thoses put-downs are delivered with an air of superioirty, as if the speaker wants to put some distance between the bidder and the biddee, and intentional insults will do the trick  belligerent responses  provocative or combative. a sense that the speaker is looking for a fight. they would argue with whatever the bidder says. involve unfair teasing or a dare  contradictory responses  less hostile but still blocks the bidder\u0026rsquo;s attempt to connect  domineering responses  the goal is to get the bidder to withdraw, retreat, or submit  critical responses  broad-based attacks on a bidder\u0026rsquo;s character  defensive responses  create a sense of separation by allowing the speaker to relinquish responsibility for matters at hand. they may have simply developed a personal style of relating thats crabby or irritable often its a spillover of self-criticism that has its origins in the distant past. the problem may also be a biologically based irritability that is chemically related to depression  the kind of message it sends  your need for attention makes me angry i feel hostile toward you i dont respect you i dont value you or this relationship i want to hurt you i want to drive you away  exercise: create an emotion log  document my progress toward impriving emotional communication  answers these questions  what did i notice today about the way i make bids for connection with impoortant people in my life how did i feel about the way people responded to my bids did i notice anybody turning toward? turning away? turning against? what did that behavior look like? was there anything about the way i made my bid that might have affected their choice in turning? is there anything i might do differently next time? what did i notice today about the way i responded to other people\u0026rsquo;s bids for connection? did i notice myself turning toward, turning away, or turning against other people? what did that behavior look like?  was there something about the way that person made his or her bid that affected my choice in turning? can i make a different choice\u0026gt;

I can enjoy solidue in a crowded place. solitude can be disturbed in the form of reading a book, listening to a podcst, watching TV, or performing just about any activity. solitude requires me to move past reacting to information created by other people and focus instead on my own thoguhts and experiences.   All of humanity\u0026rsquo;s problems stem from man\u0026rsquo;s inability to sit quietly in a room alone. - Blaise Pascal-\n  I have read abundance of fine things on the subject of solitude\u0026hellip; I acknowledge solitude an agreeable refreshment to a busy mind. - Ben Franklin-\n  Edward Gibbon lived a solitary life. but he was very productive and happy. A great deal of time alone is the common factor among creative people. the ability to be alone is a rejection of close bonds. it helps build appreciation for interpersonal connections when they do occur.   We enter solitude, in which also we lose loneliness -Wendell Berry\n Solitude deprivation  oh my god. we allow headphones to provide background noise for our entire day. it undermines our time alone with our own thoughts. Spotify provides me the ability to be CONSTANTLY distracted from my own mind. it is pushing us toward a newly alienated phase in our relationship with our own minds. the smartphone provided a new technique to banish these remaining slivers of solitude: a quick glane we\u0026rsquo;ve been sold the idea that more connectivity is better than less. without solitude, I lose the ability to clarify hard problems, regulate my emotions, build moral courage, strengthen relationships. if i suffer from chronic solitude deprivation, the quality of my life degrades. smartphones make you anxious. humans are not wired to be constantly wired  practice 1 leave my phone at home practice 2 take long walks  walk in scenic places without headphones. time doing this is an investment.  practice 3 write letters to yourself dont click like??  man is by nature a social animal.social cognition: when given downtime, our brain defaults to thinking about our social life. people are naturlaly interested in their own social life. social media makes me feel both connected and lonely, happy and sad. the more you use social media to interact with your network, the less time you devote to offline communication. there exists a tradeoff. using social media tends to take pepole away from the real world socializing thats massively more valuable. the small boosts i receive from posting on a friend\u0026rsquo;s wall or liking their latest Ig photo can\u0026rsquo;t come close to compensating for the large loss experience by no longer spending real world time with that same friend. IRL interactions require our brains to process large amounts of info about subtle analog cues such as body language, facial expressions, and voice tone. digital tools underutilize our social processing networks. humans are naturally biased toward activities that require less energy in the short term. even if it\u0026rsquo;s more harmful in the longterm. so we end up texting our sibling instead of calling them on the phone. or liking a picture of a friend\u0026rsquo;s new baby instead of stopping by to visit. its difficult to reist checking a device in the middle of a conversation. our dumb brain cant distinguish betwee nthe importance of the person in the room with us and the new person who just us a new text. novel tools are engineerd to hijack our primitive brain, having a very addictive allure. if i spend multiple hours a day compulsively clicking and swiping. theres much less free time left for slower interactions. we are also delusional in thinking that we\u0026rsquo;re actually building or maintaining our relationships. making further action unnecessary. conversation is what counts. those whose relationship with you only exists on social media: let them go.  reclaiming conversation  face-to-face conversation is the most human and humanizing thing we do. fully present to one another, we learn to listen. its where we develop the capacity for empathy. its where we experience the joy of being heard, of being understood. young employees retreat to email because the thought of an unstructured conversation terrifies them, and uncessary office tensions that fester when communication shifts from nuanced conversation to ambiguous connection f2f convo unfolds slowly. it teaches patience. we attend to tone and nance. when we communicate on our digital devices, we learn different habits.  not anti-technology. it\u0026rsquo;s pro-convo  anything textual or non-interactive \u0026ndash; all social media, email, text, instant message, doesnt count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection.a logistical role. as in. it should be used to set up and arrange conversation. or to efficiently transfer practical onfo. connection MUST BE a supporter to conversation.   real conversation takes time  conversation is the good stuff. it is what we crave as humans and what provides us with the sense of community and belonging necessary to thrive you cannot expect an app dreamed up in a dorm room, or among pingpong tables of a silicon valley incubator to replace the types of rich interactions to which we\u0026rsquo;ve painstakingly adapted over millennia. our sociality is simply too complex to be outsourced to a social network or reduced to instant messages and emojis.  practice 4 consolicate texting  phones have become woven into a fraught sense of obligation in friendship. the more we text the less necessary you\u0026rsquo;ll deem real conversation and when i get the chance to actually talk i\u0026rsquo;ll compulsively check my phone keep do not disturb mode on my default  practice 5 hold conversation office hours  tell my friends and acquaintances that i\u0026rsquo;ll be able to talk to them at a certain time. no need to schedule literally just call me at that time.  reclaim leasure  the best and most pleasant life is the life of the intellect - mf Aristotle it\u0026rsquo;s easy to fill the gaps between work and caring for my self and sleep by pulling a smartphone or tablet, and numbing myself with mindless swiping and tapping.  bennet principle financial independece: my assets produce enough income to cover my living expenses. when i achieve FI, i have more leisure hours to fill than the average person. so theres a community behind this movement and they provide valuable insights into high value leisure.\npassive leisure activities associated with young men  palying video games, watching sports, web surfing, long evenings at the bar.   when we are provided large amounts of leisure time, we often voluntarily fill these hours with strenuous activity. Inactivity leads to depressive boredom.   I wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life. \u0026ndash; teddy roosevelt\n  hours should be put to use on demanding and virtuous leisure activities.

Note that this post is literally me taking notes (more like copying verbatim) of what the author wrote and I have absolutely no rights to the material provided. Don\u0026rsquo;t @ me.\n The working class has experienced economic stagnation and precarity, and even life expectancy in the US, as well as ower family stability and civic engagement. Social mobility has declined, while inequality has widened. [the working class] has scarecely any political agency in the current system and no apparent means for acquiring any. At most, working-class voters can cast their votes but can exercise no influence on policy formation, agency personnel, governance areas (that have been trasnferred to technocratic bodies?) While a restive working class might provide fertile ground for political upheavals, any fundamental transformation of Western politics will necessarily be led by increasing numbers of the \u0026ldquo;elite\u0026rdquo; who defect and rethink their allegiance to establishment paradigms. 4.Conventional narratives, including many that are critical of the status quo, paint the elite as a unified block aligned with neoliberalism. But the neoliberal economy has created a profound fracture within the elite, the significance of which is just beginning to be felt. The socioeconomic divide that will determine the future of politics, particularly in the US, is not between the top X percent and the rest (1% vs 99%). The real class war is between the 0.1 percent and (at most) the 10 percent. Precisely, between elites primarily dependent on capital gains and those primarily dependent on professional labor. At bottom, the economy that has been constructed over the last few decades is nothing more than a capital accumulation economy. As long as returns on capital exceed returns on labor, then the largest capital holders benefit the most, inequality rises, and wealth becomes more and more narrowly concentrated. Marxian thinkers have been analyzing theses dynamics for almost two centuries, but they have often misread the political effects of these developments, which play out primariliy among the elite managerial class, rather than within the binary of capitalists and proletarians. Lost amid the celabrations of the \u0026ldquo;information economy\u0026rdquo; in recent decades is the fact that elite career trajectories are no longer what they used to be.  Big Law associate salaries at white-shoe firms remained flat from 2007 to 2016.\nFinance no longer delivers for the top 5% even though firm profits are high. average compensation for mid-level employees in sales and trading has fallen by half while investment banker salaries have been reduced by one-third\nhedge funds returns have been disappointing typical employees can enjoy a comfortable lifestyle but unlikely to accumulate sybstantioal capital themselves private equity is healthier but has become highly competitive and increasingly reliant on financial engineering gimmicks, such as selling companies between funds managed by the same firm\nWhat the fuck does this mean?\n In short, the effects of financialization on the real econ­omy are being replicated within the industry itself—the upward redistribution of rents within a context of overall deceleration.\n Silicon Valley  brightest star in the new economy universe. THE VALLEY HAS NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY FERTILE FOR THE SALARIED PROFESSIONALS AND \u0026ldquo;ENGINNERS\u0026rdquo; HIRED BY THESE COMPANIES, WHO EVEN NOW GENERALLY MAKE LESS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON WALL STREET OR IN BIG LAW the median salary for US IT workers, who frequently must live in high-priced urban areas, is only $81k increasing numbers of engineers, even at the most prestigious companies, are hired on temprary contracts. when artificial growth model stalls, employees can expect mass layoffs, \u0026ldquo;anti-hierarchy\u0026rdquo; propaganda notwithstanding many positions that require advanced degrees, large student loans, living in expensive cities barely pay $100k a year  Other professionals  fare worse career prospects of journalists and academics- ironic casualties of the \u0026ldquo;information economy\u0026rdquo;- are declining even more the conspicuous embrace of \u0026ldquo;elite values\u0026rdquo; by journalists and academics is often little more than an aspirational attempt to remain connected to an economically distant elite- just as educated millenials' conspicuous consumption of \u0026ldquo;experiences\u0026rdquo; often serves as a necessary distraction from the grim reality that most will never be able to own a home.  The rising cost of elite membership Facts   \u0026ldquo;low income\u0026rdquo; threshold in Norcal is ~ $117k\n  top 10% US household income threshold is $187k\n  what exists: deindustrialization and sectoral clustering, financialization and rising intra-elite inequality\n  global oligarchs buying investment properties and pieds-à-terre in prime urban areas to price out professional elites =\u0026gt; displaced elites began gentrifying working-class and middle-class neighborhoods\n  the costs of passing elite status quo onto children-elite education- rose rapidly.\n  while the costs of education have risen, since 2000 the rewards have been declining. Wages for young college graduates actually feel.\n  upper middle class american radicals  everything mentioned above has a more pronounced impact on the professional elite than on the working class, which was already largely marginalized by that point elites outside of the very top found themselves falling further behind their supposed cultural peers, without being able to look forward to rapidly rising incomes for themselves members of the elite often seem far more radical than the working class, both in their candidate choices and overall outlook, lower-level elites appear to be experiencing far mor intense status anxiety there is more \u0026ldquo;socialist\u0026rdquo; organizing in Silicon Valley and elite college campuses today than in working class exurbs. Mayy of the most aggressive proposals assoaciated with the Left- such as student loan forgiveness and \u0026ldquo;free college\u0026rdquo; are targeted at the top 30%. Medicare for All could potentially benefit households earning between $100k and $200k the most, cohorts below that are already subsidized. Whatever the underlying merits of \u0026ldquo;woke\u0026rdquo; critiques and causes might be, these postures are mainly adopted in intra-elite competition for positions and influence. personal trajectory of Elizabeth Warren, almost prefectly represnets the political trajectory of the professional class: first they abandoned the Republican Party and then continued to move further into the left wing of the Democratic Party. this displays \u0026ldquo;class consciousness.\u0026rdquo; the recent leftward movement of the upper iddle class recalls the rightward drift that occurred in the 1970s and 80s. political priorities are almost always set by the affluent, after all- and could also be interpreted as a response to changing economic circumstances  self perpetuation of conservative mediocrity  the republican party faces a very different problem: the absence of any significant professional elite, which abandoned the party long ago. the author sounds biased as fuck I won\u0026rsquo;t take notes this part  The alienation of elite labor  beyond economic pressures, at least two additional sources of elite anxiety will push in this direction: the emptiness of today\u0026rsquo;s professional careers and the obtuseness of the billionaire class working-class jobs have become more precarious and demeaning, professional jobs have become more meanigless and depressing \u0026ldquo;bullshit jobs\u0026rdquo; and their proliferation throughout the corporate world and other sectors  ","permalink":"https://blog.banhtrang.me/en/note/class-war/","summary":"Excerpts from American Affairs' The Real Class War.

It\u0026rsquo;s sad and pathetic but it\u0026rsquo;s also enlightening, I guess.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s enlightening in a way that most people I\u0026rsquo;ve met feel this way. The memes about doomers (or as boomers affectionately call them fuckin' entitled millenials/gen z) are true. We are sad. We are aimless. We spend more time on the phone than ever before. Our daily hit of dopamine probably comes from a popular social media platform.\nMost of us feel that we are not living up to our expectations and that we have to atone for it. While rationally I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that this is true, we haven\u0026rsquo;t seen but a modicum of how vast and beautiful this world is. Yet we, or at least I and my friends, condition ourselves to think of our personal developments as an ultimate truth in life. Anyday that we are not working toward that goal is a day wasted. In another word, we are taught to measure our self worth based on our contributions to the world. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be that bad if the byproduct of that thinking is a sense of dread and self-pity if we fail to achieve things we want.\nAt least that\u0026rsquo;s what I feel. But feel is an overloaded word. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like this as if this is a core belief of mine. I feel like this when I\u0026rsquo;m tired. I feel aimless like this when I\u0026rsquo;m not managing my time so that I can spend most of my time doing things that I find meaningful.\nTo put it in a way that most of my friends can relate, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing the logistics too long. I have been taking classes, learning soft skills, improving myself. Things like those surely lay a good foundation to everything, they are like the tutorial parts of a video game. But it is only there to make sure I know how to play a game. It is inherently unrewarding because its sole purpose is to guy players towards the meaningful part. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been grinding this tutorial for too long. Or is it? Who knows.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m saying is, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m barely touching the tips of the iceberg. Life is more than just waking up, going to class, going to the library to do homework, and writing a blogpost complaining how you\u0026rsquo;re tired of doing all of those for too long.\nBut of course, the whole thing that I just said is simply not true. I probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t treat my life as either meaningful or meaningless.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny, I know that what ever I think of right now. Somebody smarter and more educated had thought of this before and had written about it. They had probably come to a better conclusion. Well, I should treat this essay as a concretization of my little system of beliefs when I was 20. I should read more.\nIn a time of senselessness, what do I seek? Will it be Nietschze, will it be ancient Buddhist texts, will it be Netflix, a talk with one of my friends, or do I just power through all of this all by myself?\nGoddamn it, I hate meta questions. I just want to do something rewarding. Something that is beneficial in the long term. At the same time, though, I hate doing grudge work. Why? Because I only live once.

I don\u0026rsquo;t exactly know why but my guess is that most young people are trying to find a place in the world for themselves. Ideologies help many people mentally work out their place in the world, how they can work towards something meaningful, and most importantly, how they can be a part of something bigger than themselves.\nI know this is a funny thing to say, but public version of Lee Kuan Yew is someone I aspire to be.\nAside from his political side, I like how he navigates around life. Mr Lee appears to be one of the few affluent politicians with a wide range of personality. He is known to have said controversial things, written controversial essays, and held many politically incorect opinions. I can see him as the Jordan Peterson of politics. He is not afraid of public opinion.\nPeople see him in different ways but I believe that\u0026rsquo;s how he wants to be seen. He probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t like being a likable figure throughout his lifetime and then have somebody put words in his mouth posthumously for some political gains.\nThe most interesting thing is, he has his ways with words. I don\u0026rsquo;t doubt for a second the complexity of his ideas but he always manages to communicate them effectively. Who knows, maybe his clarity of ideas is the reason for his government\u0026rsquo;s competence.

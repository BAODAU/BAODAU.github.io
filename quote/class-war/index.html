<p>Excerpts from <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/11/the-real-class-war/">American Affairs&rsquo; The Real Class War</a>. Note that this post is literally me taking notes (more like copying verbatim) of what the author wrote and I have absolutely no rights to the material provided. Don&rsquo;t @ me.</p>

<ol>
<li>The working class has experienced economic stagnation and precarity, and even life expectancy in the US, as well as ower family stability and civic engagement. Social mobility has declined, while inequality has widened.</li>
<li>[the working class] has scarecely any political agency in the current system and no apparent means for acquiring any. At most, working-class voters can cast their votes but can exercise no influence on policy formation, agency personnel, governance areas (that have been trasnferred to technocratic bodies?)</li>
<li>While a restive working class might provide fertile ground for political upheavals, any fundamental transformation of Western politics will necessarily be led by increasing numbers of the &ldquo;elite&rdquo; who defect and rethink their allegiance to establishment paradigms.
4.<strong>Conventional narratives, including many that are critical of the status quo, paint the elite as a unified block aligned with neoliberalism. But the neoliberal economy has created a profound fracture within the elite, the significance of which is just beginning to be felt.</strong></li>
<li>The socioeconomic divide that will determine the future of politics, particularly in the US, is not between the top X percent and the rest (1% vs 99%). The real class war is between the 0.1 percent and (at most) the 10 percent. Precisely, between elites primarily dependent on capital gains and those primarily dependent on professional labor.</li>
<li>At bottom, the economy that has been constructed over the last few decades is nothing more than a capital accumulation economy. As long as returns on capital exceed returns on labor, then the largest capital holders benefit the most, inequality rises, and wealth becomes more and more narrowly concentrated. Marxian thinkers have been analyzing theses dynamics for almost two centuries, but <em>they have often misread the political effects of these developments, which play out primariliy among the elite managerial class</em>, rather than within the binary of capitalists and proletarians.</li>
<li>Lost amid the celabrations of the &ldquo;information economy&rdquo; in recent decades is the fact that elite career trajectories are no longer what they used to be.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="big-law">Big Law</h3>

<p>associate salaries at white-shoe firms remained flat from 2007 to 2016.</p>

<h3 id="finance">Finance</h3>

<p>no longer delivers for the top 5% even though firm profits are high.
average compensation for mid-level employees in sales and trading has fallen by half while investment banker salaries have been reduced by one-third</p>

<h3 id="hedge-funds">hedge funds</h3>

<p>returns have been disappointing
typical employees can enjoy a comfortable lifestyle but unlikely to accumulate sybstantioal capital themselves
private equity is healthier but has become highly competitive and increasingly reliant on financial engineering gimmicks, such as selling companies between funds managed by the same firm</p>

<p>What the fuck does this mean?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In short, the effects of financialization on the real econ­omy are being replicated within the industry itself—the upward redistribution of rents within a context of overall deceleration.</p>

<h3 id="silicon-valley">Silicon Valley</h3>

<ul>
<li>brightest star in the new economy universe.</li>
<li><strong>THE VALLEY HAS NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY FERTILE FOR THE SALARIED PROFESSIONALS AND &ldquo;ENGINNERS&rdquo; HIRED BY THESE COMPANIES, WHO EVEN NOW GENERALLY MAKE LESS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON WALL STREET OR IN BIG LAW</strong></li>
<li>the median salary for US IT workers, who frequently must live in high-priced urban areas, is only $81k</li>
<li>increasing numbers of engineers, even at the most prestigious companies, are hired on temprary contracts.</li>
<li>when artificial growth model stalls, employees can expect mass layoffs, &ldquo;anti-hierarchy&rdquo; propaganda notwithstanding</li>
<li>many positions that require advanced degrees, large student loans, living in expensive cities barely pay $100k a year</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-professionals">Other professionals</h3>

<ul>
<li>fare worse</li>
<li>career prospects of journalists and academics- ironic casualties of the &ldquo;information economy&rdquo;- are declining even more</li>
<li>the conspicuous embrace of &ldquo;elite values&rdquo; by journalists and academics is often little more than an aspirational attempt to remain connected to an economically distant elite- just as educated millenials&rsquo; conspicuous consumption of &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; often serves as a necessary distraction from the grim reality that most will never be able to own a home.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-rising-cost-of-elite-membership">The rising cost of elite membership</h3>

<h3 id="facts">Facts</h3>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;low income&rdquo; threshold in Norcal is ~ $117k</li>

<li><p>top 10% US household income threshold is $187k</p></li>

<li><p>what exists: deindustrialization and sectoral clustering, financialization and rising intra-elite inequality</p></li>

<li><p>global oligarchs buying investment properties and pieds-à-terre in prime urban areas to price out professional elites =&gt; displaced elites began gentrifying working-class and middle-class neighborhoods</p></li>

<li><p>the costs of passing elite status quo onto children-elite education- rose rapidly.</p></li>

<li><p>while the costs of education have risen, since 2000 the rewards have been declining. Wages for young college graduates actually feel.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="upper-middle-class-american-radicals">upper middle class american radicals</h3>

<ul>
<li>everything mentioned above has a more pronounced impact on the professional elite than on the working class, which was already largely marginalized by that point</li>
<li>elites outside of the very top found themselves falling further behind their supposed cultural peers, without being able to look forward to rapidly rising incomes for themselves</li>
<li>members of the elite often seem far more radical than the working class, both in their candidate choices and overall outlook, lower-level elites appear to be experiencing far mor intense status anxiety</li>
<li>there is more &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; organizing in Silicon Valley and elite college campuses today than in working class exurbs. Mayy of the most aggressive proposals assoaciated with the Left- such as student loan forgiveness and &ldquo;free college&rdquo; are targeted at the top 30%. Medicare for All could potentially benefit households earning between $100k and $200k the most, cohorts below that are already subsidized. Whatever the underlying merits of &ldquo;woke&rdquo; critiques and causes might be, these postures are mainly adopted in intra-elite competition for positions and influence.</li>
<li>personal trajectory of Elizabeth Warren, almost prefectly represnets the political trajectory of the professional class: first they abandoned the Republican Party and then continued to move further into the left wing of the Democratic Party.  this displays &ldquo;class consciousness.&rdquo;</li>
<li>the recent leftward movement of the upper iddle class recalls the rightward drift that occurred in the 1970s and 80s.</li>
<li>political priorities are almost always set by the affluent, after all- and could also be interpreted as a response to changing economic circumstances</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="self-perpetuation-of-conservative-mediocrity">self perpetuation of conservative mediocrity</h3>

<ul>
<li>the republican party faces a very different problem: the absence of any significant professional elite, which abandoned the party long ago.</li>
<li>the author sounds biased as fuck I won&rsquo;t take notes this part</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-alienation-of-elite-labor">The alienation of elite labor</h3>

<ul>
<li>beyond economic pressures, at least two additional sources of elite anxiety will push in this direction: the emptiness of today&rsquo;s professional careers and the obtuseness of the billionaire class</li>
<li>working-class jobs have become more precarious and demeaning, professional jobs have become more meanigless and depressing</li>
<li>&ldquo;bullshit jobs&rdquo; and their proliferation throughout the corporate world and other sectors</li>

      <description>This blog is written for my Gen Z/millenial friends out there.
Imagine a typical school day. You wake up, turn off the alarm. The next thing you do, instinctively, is to check your social media.
After all, man&amp;rsquo;s search for happiness might just be man&amp;rsquo;s search for stimuli.
&amp;ldquo;A certain amount of boredom is essential to a happy life.&amp;rdquo;
Kant&amp;rsquo;s notion of the sublime - our own insignificance in the universe around us.</description>

      <title>What I feel</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s meta, but I feel like no matter I do, I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to feel like how I want to feel.
Not that I have achieved a lot and feel empty afterwards. Full disclaimer, I have not achieved a single thing that I wanted to do this year. It&amp;rsquo;s sad and pathetic but it&amp;rsquo;s also enlightening, I guess.
It&amp;rsquo;s enlightening in a way that most people I&amp;rsquo;ve met feel this way.</description>

      <title>on Lee Kuan Yew</title>

      <description>I found myself thinking about what Lee Kuan Yew had to say about many things a lot recently. While I know close to nothing about him, I can imagine that most of his thoughts and actions stemmed from a systemic and practical approach.
I remember reading him stating that while he takes a certain liking to some ideas, he is only interested in what works in real life. This Machiavellian approach to problems reminds me of one of Charlie Munger&amp;rsquo;s lessons in life: avoid extremely intense ideology.</description>

<p>dont confuse goals with desires</p>

<h1 id="most-problems-are-potential-improvements">most problems are potential improvements</h1>

<p>list my problems.</p>

<p>if i cant identify my problems thats because either i lack the skill or lack the will :)</p>

<p>the problems are <em>harsh reality</em>, very painful to look at. so i cope my subconsciously put them out of sight to make them out of mind</p>

<p>i defintely <em>worry about appearing to not have problems</em> than about not achieving my desired results.</p>

<p>so what i do is <em>avoid recognizing that my mistakes and/or weaknesses</em> are causing the problems</p>

<p>are there any problems that im not perceptive enough to see.</p>

<p>some people are unable to distinguish big problems from small ones. this is me. my carelessness has turned my life into a mess.</p>

<p><em><em>try to remain centered and logical</em></em> its very easy to react emotionally, seek sympathy. i have to feel the pain, the kind of pain that will test my character and reward me if i push through them.</p>

<h2 id="my-impediments-are-due-largely-to-issues-of-will-unwillingness-to-confront-what-is-really-happening">my impediments are due largely to issues of will: unwillingness to confront what/ is really happening</h2>

<ul>
<li>lack of skill or innate talent: have others point out problems to me and myself objectively consider whether what they say is true.</li>
<li>problems due to inadequte skill might then be solved with training, problems from innate weaknesses might &ldquo;be overcome with assistance or role changes&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dont-confuse-problems-with-causes">dont confuse problems with causes?</h3>

<h3 id="identify-the-problems-then-do-not-tolerate-them">identify the problems, then DO NOT TOLERATE THEM</h3>

<ul>
<li>might be due to thinking they can&rsquo;t be solved</li>
<li>or not caring enough about solving them</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-much-am-i-tolerating-problems">how much am i tolerating problems?</h4>

<ul>
<li>people who are good at this step: identifying and not tolerating problems</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="relationships-between-steps">relationships between steps</h4>

<ul>
<li>goals are the sole purpose of designs and tasks. ask why to connect tasks and goals. stick too rigidly to specified tasks and are not commited enough to achieving their goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>ask myself what i want, then ask &lsquo;what is true, then asks &lsquo;what should be done about it&rsquo;</p>

<p>ask myself what is my biggest weakness that stands in the way of what i want</p>

<p>everyone has weaknesses. successful people find and address them.</p>

<p>society has taught us that having weaknesses is bad. so finding our own weaknesses very painful.</p>

<p><em>i can only get what i want out of life i can open-mindedly reflect, with the help of others, on what is standing in my way and then deal with it</em></p>

<p>understand what i am weak at and successfully compensate for that weakness by seeking help.</p>

<h3 id="trust-in-truth">trust in truth</h3>

<ul>
<li>realize that i have nothing to fear from truth</li>
<li>be extremely open</li>
<li>have integrity and demand it from others
never say anything about a person you wouldn&rsquo;t say to them directly. dont try people without accusing them to their face. dont let &lsquo;loyalty&rsquo; stand in the way of truth and openness</li>
<li>be radically transparent
record almost all meetings and share them with all relevant people</li>
<li>dont tolerate dishonesty
dont believe when someone caught being dishonest says they have seen the light and will never do that sort of thing again</li>
</ul>

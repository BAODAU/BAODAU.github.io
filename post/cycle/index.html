    <p>It&rsquo;s meta, but I feel like no matter I do, I won&rsquo;t be able to feel like how I want to feel.</p>

<p>Not that I have achieved a lot and feel empty afterwards. Full disclaimer, I have not achieved a single thing that I wanted to do this year. It&rsquo;s sad and pathetic but it&rsquo;s also enlightening, I guess.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s enlightening in a way that most people I&rsquo;ve met feel this way. The memes about doomers (or as boomers affectionately call them fuckin&rsquo; entitled millenials/gen z) are true. We are sad. We are aimless. We spend more time on the phone than ever before. Our daily hit of dopamine probably comes from a popular social media platform.</p>

<p>Most of us <em>feel</em> that we are not living up to our expectations and that we have to atone for it. While rationally I don&rsquo;t believe that this is true, we haven&rsquo;t seen but a modicum of how vast and beautiful this world is. Yet we, or at least I and my friends, condition ourselves to think of our personal developments as an ultimate truth in life. Anyday that we are not working toward that goal is a day wasted. In another word, we are taught to measure our self worth based on our contributions to the world. It wouldn&rsquo;t be that bad if the byproduct of that thinking is a sense of dread and self-pity if we fail to achieve things we want.</p>

<p>At least that&rsquo;s what I feel. But <em>feel</em> is an overloaded word. I don&rsquo;t feel like this as if this is a core belief of mine. I feel like this when I&rsquo;m tired. I feel aimless like this when I&rsquo;m not managing my time so that I can spend most of my time doing things that I find meaningful.</p>

<p>To put it in a way that most of my friends can relate, I feel like I&rsquo;ve been doing the logistics too long. I have been taking classes, learning soft skills, improving myself. Things like those surely lay a good foundation to everything, they are like the tutorial parts of a video game. But it is only there to make sure I know how to play a game. It is inherently unrewarding because its sole purpose is to guy players towards the meaningful part. And I&rsquo;ve been grinding this tutorial for too long. Or is it? Who knows.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, I feel like I&rsquo;m barely touching the tips of the iceberg. Life is more than just waking up, going to class, going to the library to do homework, and writing a blogpost complaining how you&rsquo;re tired of doing all of those for too long.</p>

<p>But of course, the whole thing that I just said is simply not true. I probably shouldn&rsquo;t treat my life as either meaningful or meaningless.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, I know that what ever I think of right now. Somebody smarter and more educated had thought of this before and had written about it. They had probably come to a better conclusion. Well, I should treat this essay as a concretization of my little system of beliefs when I was 20. I should read more.</p>

<p>In a time of senselessness, what do I seek? Will it be Nietschze, will it be ancient Buddhist texts, will it be Netflix, a talk with one of my friends, or do I just power through all of this all by myself?</p>

<p>Goddamn it, I hate meta questions. I just want to do something rewarding. Something that is beneficial in the long term. At the same time, though, I hate doing grudge work. Why? Because I only live once. I am entitled to wanting stuff and getting it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about Buddhishm. But I vaguely remember that the moment I&rsquo;ve asked for the wrong thing, I would spend my life chasing the ephemeral stuff. Well guess what. I&rsquo;m not trying to live my life the perfect way. I&rsquo;m going to be a sponge.</p>

<p>Yeah you heard me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be a sponge.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll listen to what people have to say.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll learn as much as I can.</p>

<p>Ugh, this whole essay just screams I need meds. But I&rsquo;m not diagnosed with anything, yet. I might need some, though.</p>

<p>Also I&rsquo;ll start a daily vlog and it&rsquo;s gonna be sick.</p>
